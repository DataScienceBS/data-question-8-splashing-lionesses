1456,1770,0001055160-18-000005,share_repurchase_auth,"because the terms of our repurchase transactions typically range from one to six months at inception, the interest rates on our borrowings generally adjust more frequently (as new repurchase transactions are entered into upon the maturity of existing repurchase transactions) than the interest rates on our investments."

2014,2414,0001206264-18-000033,share_repurchase_auth,"our degree of leverage could have important consequences to our investors, such as:  • increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;  • requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and other business opportunities;  • making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;  • restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or investments or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;  • limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;  • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate, placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting;  • exposing us to variability in interest rates, as a substantial portion of our indebtedness is and will be at variable rates; and  • limiting our ability to return capital to our stockholders, including through share repurchases."

2750,3323,0001465740-18-000031,share_repurchase_auth,our primary financing sources for agency rmbs and non-agency securities are repurchase agreements and fhlb advances.

2753,3326,0001465740-18-000031,share_repurchase_auth,the difference between the sale price and repurchase price is the interest expense of financing under a repurchase agreement.
2754,3327,0001465740-18-000031,share_repurchase_auth,"under repurchase agreement financing arrangements, if the value of the collateral decreases, the buyer could require the seller to provide additional cash collateral to re-establish the ratio of value of the collateral to the amount of borrowing (i.e., a margin call)."
2755,3328,0001465740-18-000031,share_repurchase_auth,"in the current economic climate, lenders under repurchase agreements generally advance approximately 90% to 97% of the market value of the agency rmbs financed (a discount from market value, generally referred to as a haircut, of 3% to 10%) and 50% to 75% of the market value of the non-agency securities financed (i.e., a haircut of 25% to 50%)."
2756,3329,0001465740-18-000031,share_repurchase_auth,"to finance msr, we enter into repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities collateralized by the value of the msr pledged."

2758,3331,0001465740-18-000031,share_repurchase_auth,we expect to mitigate our risk of margin calls under repurchase agreements by deploying leverage at an amount that is below what could be used under current advance rates.
2759,3332,0001465740-18-000031,share_repurchase_auth,"in order to reduce our exposure to risks associated with lender counterparty concentration, we generally seek to diversify our exposure by entering into repurchase agreements with multiple counterparties."

2762,3335,0001465740-18-000031,share_repurchase_auth,"for purposes of calculating the management fee, our stockholders' equity means the sum of the net proceeds from all issuances of our equity securities since inception (allocated on a pro rata daily basis for such issuances during the fiscal quarter of any such issuance), plus our retained earnings at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter (without taking into account any non-cash equity compensation expense incurred in current or prior periods), less the consolidated stockholders' equity of granite point and its subsidiaries during the time granite point was consolidated on our balance sheet, the weighted average cost basis of granite point common stock purchased, the outstanding principal balance of the promissory note due from the sale of granite point preferred stock and any amount that we have paid for repurchases of our common stock since inception, and excluding any unrealized gains, losses or other items that do not affect realized net income (regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income)."

2764,3337,0001465740-18-000031,share_repurchase_auth,our primary source of leverage is short-term repurchase agreement financing for our agency rmbs and non-agency securities.
2765,3338,0001465740-18-000031,share_repurchase_auth,we also use revolving credit facilities and repurchase agreements to finance msr.
2766,3339,0001465740-18-000031,share_repurchase_auth,"for example, by entering into repurchase agreements with advance rates, or haircut levels, of 5% (which is not an atypical haircut for agency rmbs), we could leverage capital allocated to agency rmbs by a ratio of as much as 20 to 1."
2767,3340,0001465740-18-000031,share_repurchase_auth,it is not uncommon for investors in agency rmbs to obtain leverage equal to ten or more times equity through the use of repurchase agreement financing.
2768,3341,0001465740-18-000031,share_repurchase_auth,"we depend on repurchase agreements and other credit facilities to execute our business plan and any limitation on our ability to access funding through these sources could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business."
2769,3342,0001465740-18-000031,share_repurchase_auth,our ability to purchase and hold assets is affected by our ability to secure repurchase agreements and other credit facilities on acceptable terms.
2770,3343,0001465740-18-000031,share_repurchase_auth,"we currently have repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities and other credit facilities in place with several counterparties, including national banks and the fhlb."
2771,3344,0001465740-18-000031,share_repurchase_auth,"in the future we may enter into additional or increase commitment amounts under our existing repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities and credit facilities, but we can provide no assurance that lenders will be willing or able to provide us with sufficient financing through the repurchase markets or otherwise."

Business\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) is a provider of communications services in the\\nUnited States, with approximately 4.9 million customers, 3.9 million broadband subscribers and 22,700\\nemployees, operating in 29 states. In recent years, Frontier has completed multiple acquisitions. On April 1,\\n2016, we acquired the wireline operations of Verizon Communications, Inc. in California, Texas and Florida for\\na purchase price of $10,540 million in cash and assumed debt.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier\\'s Service Territories\\n\\ufeff\\n\\nHow We Serve Our Customers\\n\\ufeff\\nWe conduct business with both consumer and commercial customers.\\n\\ufeff\\nConsumer. We provide broadband, video, voice and\\nother services and products to our consumer customers. We deliver these services generally over a combination\\nof fiber and copper-based networks.\\n\\ufeff\\nCommercial (small, medium and large enterprise\\nbusiness (SME) as well as wholesale customers).\\n\\ufeff\\nCommercial. We provide a broad range of services to\\nour SME customers, including broadband service, Ethernet service, traditional circuit-based services (TDM\\nservices) and voice services. We also offer advanced hardware and network solutions and services.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\no\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLarger Enterprise: Fortune 1000, multi-location\\ncompanies, large government entities, large educational institutions, and non-profits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\no\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMedium Business: Single or multi-location\\ncompanies and mid-sized government entities, educational institutions and non-profits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\no\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSmall Business: Mostly single-location businesses,\\nthe smaller of which have purchase patterns similar to consumer customers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\no\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWholesale: Wholesale\\ncustomers are often referred to as carriers or service providers and include national operators such as\\nAT&T and Verizon; Local Exchange Companies that need to access locations within Frontier\\'s footprint to\\noffer local services; and wireless carriers and integrated carriers that offer a variety of services across all of these categories. Wholesale customers buy\\nboth voice and data services to supplement their own network infrastructure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nServices and Products\\n\\ufeff\\nWe offer a broad portfolio of communications services for consumer and commercial customers.\\nThese services are offered on either a standalone basis or in a bundled package, depending on each customer\\'s\\nneeds.\\n\\ufeff\\nData and Internet services. We offer a\\ncomprehensive range of broadband and networking services. The principal consumer service we provide is\\nbroadband internet service. Commercial services include a complete portfolio of Ethernet services, dedicated\\ninternet, software defined wide area network (SDWAN), multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), time division\\nmultiplexing (TDM) data transport services and optical transport services. These services are all supported by\\n24/7 technical support and an advanced network operations center. We also offer wireless broadband services\\n(using unlicensed spectrum) in select markets utilizing networks that we own or operate.\\n\\ufeff\\nVideo services. We offer video services under\\nFiOS® brand in portions of California, Texas, Florida,\\nIndiana, Oregon and Washington, and the VantageTM brand in\\nportions of Connecticut, North Carolina, South Carolina, Minnesota, Illinois, New York, and Ohio. We also offer\\nsatellite TV video service to our customers under an agency relationship with DISH® in all of our markets.\\n\\ufeff\\nVoice services. We provide voice services,\\nincluding data-based VoIP, long-distance and voice messaging services, to consumer and commercial customers in\\nall of our markets. These services are billed monthly in advance. Long-distance service to and from points\\noutside our operating properties are provided by interconnection with the facilities of interexchange carriers.\\nOur long-distance services are billed in advance for unlimited use service, and billed in arrears for services\\non a per minute-of-use basis.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe also offer packages of communications services. These packages permit customers to bundle\\ntheir products and services, including voice service, video and Internet services, and other product\\nofferings.\\nAccess services. We offer a range of access\\nservices. Our switched access services allow other carriers to use our facilities to originate and terminate\\ntheir local and long-distance voice traffic. These services are generally offered on a month-to-month basis and\\nthe service is billed primarily on a minutes-of-use basis. Switched access charges are based on access rates\\nfiled with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for interstate services and with the\\nrespective state regulatory agency for intrastate services. See \"Regulatory Environment\" below.\\nAdvanced Hardware and Network Solutions. We offer\\nour SME customers various hardware and network solutions utilizing cloud functionality and Customer Premise\\nEquipment (CPE). We offer third-party communications equipment tailored to their specific business needs by\\npartnering with Mitel, Cisco, Ingram Micro, Airbus, Avaya,\\nHewlett Packard, Adtran and other equipment manufacturers. CPE is typically sold in conjunction with voice,\\ndata and Internet services, and may also be sold on a standalone basis.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier Operating Strategies\\n\\ufeff\\nConsumer Business\\n\\ufeff\\nImprove Customer Experience and Retention. We\\nprovide multiple service and product options to our\\nconsumer customers. Our strategy is to foster relationships\\nand loyalty throughout the customer lifecycle in order to improve experiences, reduce churn and grow revenue.\\nOur plan to retain customers includes providing easier access to account services and trouble-shooting options\\nthrough online portals and user interfaces. We incorporate and utilize customer feedback to improve our product\\nofferings with the goal of improving the overall customer experience for our subscribers. We focus and refine\\nour marketing strategy for sales and retention to drive further improvement in the business.\\n\\ufeff\\nNew Customer Acquisition. We focus on broadband as the core growth\\ncomponent of our service offerings, either bundled with our voice and/or video services, or\\non a standalone basis. We seek to attract and retain a greater number of customers\\nand increase average revenue per customer (ARPC). We are committed to\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\ngrowing our customer base through providing higher broadband speeds and capacity that will\\nenable us to reach new markets, target new customers, and grow the business while maximizing our full\\nfootprint.\\n\\ufeff\\nImprove Revenue Trends. As we expand the range of\\nservices we offer customers, increase the capabilities of our networks, and increase the penetration of our\\nservices, we increase our revenue opportunity and are better positioned to increase the average amount of\\nrevenue we can receive from a customer.\\n\\ufeff\\nCommercial Business\\n\\ufeff\\nImprove Revenue Trends. Our strategy is to achieve\\nrevenue growth in our Commercial business through the acquisition of new customers, increasing the penetration\\nof services with existing customers, and improved retention of existing customers.\\n\\ufeff\\nOffer a Competitive Product Portfolio. We offer both\\ntraditional services as well as an expanding range of advanced, packet-based services, such as Ethernet, SDWAN,\\nUnified Communication as a Service (UCaaS) cloud-based connectivity for our large enterprise customers, and\\nmore cost-effective integrated voice and data services for our medium and small business customers.\\n\\ufeff\\nNew Customer Acquisition. We have increased our\\nsales force with an emphasis on adding new customers and increasing penetration of existing customers,\\nparticularly in areas where we have a robust fiber network.\\n\\ufeff\\nImprove Customer Experience and Retention. We plan\\nto grow our revenues in the commercial sector through increased retention and deepening of existing customer\\nrelationships. The proper alignment of our sales force, service personnel, and resources will enable us to\\nprovide excellent service to our existing enterprise,\\nmedium and small business customers, while obtaining the greatest\\nopportunities for revenue growth and expansion.\\n\\ufeff\\nCompany-Wide\\n\\ufeff\\nInvest in our Network through Capital Expenditures. Our investment focus is the enhancement of our existing network and the expansion of fiber-based\\ninfrastructure in our network. We continue to upgrade network hardware, expand\\ntransport capacity of our middle-mile\\nand data backbone, and enhance our video capabilities. Similarly, we are focused on enhancing our premium Ethernet service offerings across our network for our\\ncommercial customers.\\n\\ufeff\\nImprove Productivity and Operational Efficiency. We continuously engage in productivity\\ninitiatives with a focus on simplifying our processes, eliminating redundancies and further\\nreducing our cost structure while improving our customer service capabilities. We continue to migrate our\\nnetwork and systems to common operating platforms in order to increase efficiency and we have been migrating\\ntraffic to a common architecture to eliminate duplication.\\n\\ufeff\\nNetwork Architecture and Technology\\n\\ufeff\\nOur local exchange carrier networks consist of host central office and remote\\nsites, primarily equipped with digital and Internet\\nProtocol switches. The outside plant consists of transport and\\ndistribution delivery networks connecting our host central office with remote central offices and ultimately\\nwith our customers. We own fiber optic and copper cable, which have been deployed in our networks and are the\\nprimary transport technologies between our host and remote central offices and interconnection points with\\nother incumbent carriers.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have expanded and enhanced our fiber optic and copper transport systems to\\nsupport increasing demand for high bandwidth transport services. We routinely enhance our network and upgrade\\nwith the latest Internet Protocol Transport and routing\\nequipment, Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers (ROADM) transport systems, Very High Bit-Rate Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL)\\nbroadband equipment, and VoIP switches. These systems support advanced services such as Ethernet, Dedicated\\nInternet, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) transport, VoIP, and SDWAN. The network is designed with\\nredundancy and auto-failover capability on our major circuits.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe connect to households and business locations in our service territory using a combination of\\nfiber optic and copper technologies. In some cases we provide direct fiber into a residence or a business\\npremises. In other cases a location is served with a hybrid combination of fiber and copper. Residences in our\\nservice territory are served by fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) and by fiber-to-the-node (FTTN), meaning fiber carries\\nthe traffic to an intermediate location where the\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nsignals are converted to copper wire for the final delivery to the household.\\nWe provide data, video, and voice services to customers over both of these architectures. Additionally, fixed wireless broadband (FWB) will play an important part of our future broadband\\nstrategy and could be deployed for some business Ethernet\\nservices. FWB is delivered by the use of an antenna on\\na Frontier base location\\nand another antenna at the customer location.\\n\\ufeff\\nRapid and significant changes in technology are occurring in the\\ncommunications industry. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to\\ntechnological changes. We believe that our next generation network architecture strategy will enable us to\\nrespond to these ongoing technological changes efficiently. In addition, we anticipate reducing costs through\\nthe sharing of best practices across operations, centralization or standardization of functions and processes,\\nand deployment of technologies and systems that provide for greater efficiencies and profitability.\\nWe will continue to make strategic enhancements to our network, with a focus on higher\\nreturn investments.\\n\\ufeff\\nCompetitive Positioning\\n\\ufeff\\nCompetition for consumer customers comes from cable operators, wireless carriers and online\\nvideo providers, among others.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCable operators: In a majority of our markets,\\ncable operators offer high speed Internet, video and voice services similar to ours, and compete with us\\naggressively on speed and price by marketing their offerings with significant promotional period\\npricing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWireless carriers: Wireless operators primarily\\ncompete with us for broadband, video, and voice services in our markets by offering increasingly larger data\\npackages to mobile customers. The percentage of homes with a landline telephone has been declining, a trend we\\nexpect will continue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline video providers: Many consumers are opting\\nfor internet-delivered video services (Over the Top, or OTT) through online\\nservice providers rather than traditional, multi-channel video. In response, we have\\nmade investments in our network to deliver OTT video content to consumers who might not opt for traditional\\nvideo services. The percentage of homes with a video product has been declining, a trend we expect will\\ncontinue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nMany consumer customers prefer to bundle their voice, data, Internet and\\nvideo services with a single provider. In areas where we do not directly offer a network-based video service, we offer satellite TV video service through DISH. This\\ncan positively impact acquisition of new customers and retention of existing customers, representing a critical\\nfactor for the attachment of video, broadband and voice products. As of December 31, 2017, 50% of our consumer customers subscribed to at least\\ntwo service offerings, and 17% subscribed to at least three\\nservice offerings.\\n\\ufeff\\nCompetition for commercial customers comes from telecommunications providers,\\ncable operators, Competitive Local Exchange Companies and\\nother enterprises, some of which are substantially larger than us. As compared to our consumer customers, these\\ncustomers often require more sophisticated and more data-centered solutions (e.g., IP PBX, E911 networks,\\nEthernet and SIP trunking).\\n\\ufeff\\nIn order to remain competitive, we continue to evolve our product offerings to stay current\\nwith the changing needs of the market, to provide strong customer service and support, to invest in our network\\nso we maintain adequate capacity and can deliver new capabilities as needed, and to package our offerings to\\nmake them attractive to customers.\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nRegulatory Environment\\n\\ufeff\\nSome of our operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and various state regulatory\\nagencies, often called public service or utility commissions. We expect federal and state lawmakers, the FCC\\nand the state regulatory agencies to continue to revise the statutes and regulations governing communications\\nservices.\\nRegulation of our business\\nWe are subject to federal, state and local regulation and we have various\\nregulatory authorizations for our regulated service offerings. At the federal level, the FCC generally\\nexercises jurisdiction over information services, interstate or international telecommunications services and\\nover facilities to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate interstate or international\\nservices. State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications\\nservices and the facilities used to provide, originate or terminate those services. Most of our local exchange\\ncompanies operate as incumbent carriers in the states in which they operate and are certified in those states\\nto provide local telecommunications services. Certain federal and state agencies,\\nincluding attorneys general, monitor and exercise oversight related to consumer protection issues.\\nIn addition, local governments often regulate the public rights-of-way necessary to install\\nand operate networks and may require service providers to obtain licenses or\\nfranchises regulating their use of public rights-of-way. Municipalities and other local government agencies\\nalso may regulate other limited aspects of our business, by requiring us to obtain cable franchises and\\nconstruction permits and to abide by applicable building codes.\\nSome states\\' regulatory agencies have substantial oversight over incumbent telephone companies,\\nand their interconnection with competitive providers and provision of non-discriminatory network access to\\ncertain network elements to them. Under the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, state regulatory\\ncommissions have jurisdiction to arbitrate and review interconnection disputes and agreements between incumbent\\ntelephone companies and competitive local exchange carriers, in accordance with rules set by the FCC. The FCC\\nand some state regulatory commissions also impose fees on providers of telecommunications services to support\\nstate universal service programs. Many of the states in which we operate require prior approvals or\\nnotifications for certain acquisitions and transfers of assets, customers, or ownership of regulated\\nentities.\\n\\ufeff\\nAdditionally, in some states we are subject to operating restrictions and minimum\\nservice quality standards. Failure\\nto meet such restrictions may result in penalties. We also are required to report certain financial\\ninformation. At the federal level and in a number of the states in which we operate, we are subject to price\\ncap or incentive regulation plans under which prices for regulated services are capped. Some of these plans\\nhave limited terms and, as they expire, we may need to renegotiate with various states. These negotiations\\ncould impact rates, service quality and/or infrastructure requirements, which could also impact our earnings\\nand capital expenditures. In other states in which we operate, we are subject to rate of return regulation that\\nlimits levels of earnings and returns on investments. Approximately 19% of our total access lines at December 31, 2017 are in state jurisdictions\\nunder the rate of return regulatory model. We continue to advocate for no or reduced regulation with various\\nregulatory agencies in those states. In some of the states we operate in we have already been successful in\\nreducing or eliminating price regulation on end-user services.\\n\\ufeff\\nFederal Regulatory Environment\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier, along with all telecommunications providers, is subject to FCC rules governing\\nprivacy of specified customer information. Among other things, these rules obligate carriers to implement\\nprocedures to: protect specified customer information from inappropriate disclosure; obtain customer permission\\nto use specified information in marketing; authenticate customers before disclosing account information; and\\nannually certify compliance with the FCC\\'s rules. Although most of these regulations are generally consistent\\nwith our business plans, they may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.\\n\\ufeff\\nSome regulations are, or could in the future be, the subject of judicial proceedings,\\nlegislative hearings and administrative proposals or challenges that could change the manner in which the\\nentire industry operates. Neither the outcome of any of these developments, nor their potential impact on us,\\ncan be predicted at this time. Regulation can change rapidly in the communications industry, and such changes\\nmay have an adverse effect on us.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe current status of material regulatory initiatives is as follows:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nFederal High-Cost Subsidies: The FCC has adopted\\nrules changing the eligibility requirements for federal subsidies offered to wireline carriers providing\\nservice to high-cost, low-density markets, as well as the amounts of such subsidies, as follows:\\n\\ufeff\\nConnect America Fund (CAF): On November 18, 2011, the\\nFCC adopted the Universal Service Fund (USF)/Intercarrier Compensation (ICC) Report and Order (the 2011 Order),\\nwhich changed how federal subsidies are calculated and disbursed, and began the transition of the high-cost\\ncomponent of the Federal USF, which supported voice services in high-cost areas, to the CAF, which supports\\nbroadband deployment in high-cost areas. Frontier received $133 million from 2012 through 2014 across two\\nrounds of CAF Phase I funding to make broadband available to approximately 194,600 previously unserved or\\nunderserved locations. We completed deployment of broadband service to the first round of CAF Phase I\\nhouseholds in 2015 and to the second round of CAF Phase I locations in March 2017 as required by the FCC\\nrules.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn April 29, 2015, the FCC released offers of support to price cap carriers\\nunder the CAF Phase II program. The intent of these offers is to provide long-term support for carriers for\\nestablishing and providing broadband service with at least 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream speeds in high\\ncost areas unserved by a competitor. Frontier accepted the CAF Phase II offer in 29 states, including our CTF\\nproperties, which provides for $332 million in annual support through 2020, and a commitment to make broadband\\navailable to approximately 774,000 households. CAF Phase II support is a successor to the approximately $156\\nmillion in annual USF frozen high cost support that Frontier had been receiving prior to the CTF acquisition,\\nand the $42 million in annual transitional USF frozen high cost support that Verizon had been receiving in\\nCalifornia and Texas. In addition to the annual support levels, these amounts also include frozen support\\nphasedown amounts in states where the annual CAF II funding is less than the prior annual frozen high cost\\nsupport funding. The frozen support phasedown support was $17 million in 2017 and is expected to be $9 million\\nin 2018.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn 2017, the FCC adopted a competitive bidding process to distribute approximately $200 million\\nper year in CAF Phase II funding in those high-cost areas where price cap carriers declined the FCC\\'s offer of\\nsupport, possibly presenting a new support and deployment opportunity. The FCC released the eligible areas in\\nDecember 2017 but the competitive bidding process has not yet been fully finalized. Therefore, Frontier is\\nunable to determine whether it will participate in any competitive bid process at this time.\\n\\ufeff\\nIntercarrier Compensation: In the 2011 Order, the FCC\\nalso reformed Intercarrier Compensation, which is the payment framework that governs how carriers compensate\\neach other for the exchange of interstate switched traffic, and began a multi-year transition to the new rates.\\nThe 2011 Order provided for the gradual elimination of effectively all terminating traffic charges by July\\n2017. Frontier\\'s switched access\\nrevenue declined sequentially in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting the rate reductions mandated by the 2011\\nOrder, and we anticipate that we have experienced nearly all of the rate decline related to the 2011 Order.\\nFrontier has been able to recover a significant portion of those lost revenues through end user rates and other\\nreplacement support mechanisms, a trend we expect will continue. There are no longer any active Intercarrier\\nCompensation-related challenges to the 2011 Order. However, the 2011 Order did not resolve all questions on\\noriginating access rates. The FCC continues to consider the possibility of a transition of originating access\\nrates, although the impact on Frontier, if any, is unknown at this time. Our total\\nrevenue for Intercarrier Compensation was $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\\n\\ufeff\\nSpecial Access: In April 2016, the FCC released a\\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking on special access or \"business data\" services. It sought comment on proposed\\nchanges to the way the FCC regulates traditional special access services based on market competition, and on a\\nproposal to adopt pricing rules for Ethernet services in markets that are found to be \"noncompetitive.\" In\\nAugust 2017, the FCC\\'s decision in this proceeding, which deregulates the market for end user special access\\nservices where the market is determined to be competitive and deregulates the transport market nationwide,\\nbecame effective. This decision is generally favorable in that it gives Frontier more flexibility to operate\\nits business in a deregulated fashion like its competitors in the market. Frontier is in the process of\\nimplementing various aspects of this decision and otherwise adjusting its rates on select business data service\\nelements in response to market conditions. Some aspects of the decision are under appeal by stakeholders,\\nincluding Frontier. Whether the appeals will be successful on any grounds is unknown.\\n\\ufeff\\nIntrastate Services: Some state regulatory\\ncommissions regulate some of the rates ILECs charge for intrastate services, including originating switched\\naccess rates for intrastate access services paid by providers of intrastate long-distance services. Some states also have their own open proceedings to address\\nreform to originating intrastate access charges and other intercarrier compensation and state universal service\\nfunds. Although the FCC has pre-empted state jurisdiction on most access charges, some states could consider\\nmoving forward with their proceedings.\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nWe cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on\\nour subsidy or switched access revenues. Our total revenue for Intrastate switched\\naccess services was $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, spread across all the states we\\nserve.\\n\\ufeff\\nCurrent and Potential Internet Regulatory Obligations and Privacy: In December 2017 the FCC voted to overturn the FCC\\'s 2015 decision in which it had asserted jurisdiction over broadband service, declared broadband a \"Title II\" telecommunications service,\\nand imposed rules to \"preserve a Free and Open Internet\" (i.e., net neutrality). Specifically, the FCC voted to\\neliminate explicit bans on blocking, throttling and paid prioritization in favor of requiring Internet service\\nproviders (ISPs) to be fully transparent about their practices. Both the FCC and Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\\nwill now have a role in ensuring that the ISPs are managing their network in the manner in which they publicly\\nstate they are.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe December 2017 decision also puts ISPs on an equal footing with other\\nonline web companies with respect to privacy rules, with the FTC being the lead agency on privacy enforcement.\\nThis decision follows Congress\\'s March 2017 action under the Congressional Review Act to vacate the 2015 rules\\nthat created a separate and more onerous privacy regime for ISPs than other online web companies. Frontier\\'s\\nInternet service will now be subject to the same privacy rules as online web companies, including disclosure of\\nits practices to consumers, which is Frontier\\'s current\\npractice.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe December 2017 ruling is not yet effective and will likely be appealed\\nin court. Meanwhile, the 2015 ruling is still under appeal,\\nthough it now appears moot. Frontier continues to comply with the existing regulatory requirements, and it is\\nunclear whether the pending or future appeals will have any impact on the regulatory structure.\\n\\ufeff\\nVideo programming\\n\\ufeff\\nFederal, state and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry. Our FiOS\\nand Vantage video services are subject to, among other things: subscriber privacy regulations; requirements\\nthat we carry a local broadcast station or obtain consent to carry a local or distant broadcast station; rules\\nfor franchise renewals and transfers; the manner in which program packages are marketed to subscribers; and\\nprogram access requirements.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe provide video programming in some of our markets in California, Connecticut, Florida,\\nIllinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas and Washington\\npursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by state and local franchising authorities.\\nMost franchises are subject to termination proceedings in the event of a material breach. In addition, most\\nfranchises require payment of a franchise fee as a requirement to the granting of authority.\\n\\ufeff\\nMany franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as\\nspecific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. In many cases, franchises are\\nterminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions set forth in the franchise agreement\\ngoverning system operations. We believe that we are in compliance and meeting all material standards and\\nrequirements. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms of at least ten years and must be periodically\\nrenewed. Local franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the\\nprospective operating proposal is considered inadequate.\\n\\ufeff\\nEnvironmental regulation\\n\\ufeff\\nThe local exchange carrier subsidiaries we operate are subject to federal, state and local laws\\nand regulations governing the use, storage, disposal of, and exposure to hazardous materials, the release of\\npollutants into the environment and the remediation of contamination. As an owner and former owner of property,\\nwe are subject to environmental laws that could impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup at contaminated\\nsites, including sites formerly owned by us, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the activity that\\nresulted in contamination. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable\\nenvironmental laws and regulations.\\n\\ufeff\\nSegment Information\\n\\ufeff\\nWe currently operate in one reportable segment.\\n\\ufeff\\nFinancial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have no foreign operations.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\ufeff\\nThe dollar amount of our order backlog is not a\\nsignificant consideration in our business and is not a meaningful metric for\\nus. We have no material contracts or subcontracts that may be subject to renegotiation\\nof profits or termination at the election of the federal government.\\n\\ufeff\\nIntellectual Property\\n\\ufeff\\nWe believe that we have the trademarks, trade names and intellectual property licenses that are\\nnecessary for the operation of our business.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe own or have the rights to use various trademarks, service marks and trade\\nnames referred to in this report.

Other trademarks, trade names or service\\nmarks appearing in this report are the property of their\\nrespective owners.\\n\\ufeff\\nEmployees\\n\\ufeff\\nAs of December 31, 2017, we\\nhad approximately 22,700 employees, as compared to approximately 28,300\\nemployees as of December 31, 2016.\\nDuring 2017, reduction in workforce activities resulted in the severance of approximately\\n1,300 employees. Approximately 16,000 of our total employees are represented by unions as of\\nDecember 31, 2017. The number of employees covered by a\\ncollective bargaining agreement that expired in 2017, but have been extended and are still effective for\\n2018, is approximately 1,400. The number of employees\\ncovered by collective bargaining agreements that expire in 2018 is approximately 4,300.

Risk Factors\\n\\ufeff\\nBefore you make an investment decision with respect to any of our securities, you should\\ncarefully consider all the information we have included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent\\nfilings with the SEC. In particular, you should carefully consider the risk factors described below and the\\nrisks and uncertainties related to \"Forward-Looking Statements,\" any of which could materially adversely affect\\nour business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which\\nforward-looking statements are made in this annual report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not\\nthe only ones facing Frontier. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we\\ncurrently deem immaterial or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions, may also\\nadversely affect our business and operations. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the\\nbalance of this annual report, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in\\nthis report.\\n\\ufeff\\nRisks Related to Our Business\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have experienced declining revenues and may experience further declines in our revenues\\ngoing forward.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have experienced declining revenues as a result of declining voice services revenues, lower\\nswitched and nonswitched access revenues and declining video and data services revenues. Such declines have\\nbeen driven primarily by customer losses, changing technology and consumer behavior (such as wireless\\ndisplacement of wireline use, e-mail use, instant messaging and increasing use of VoIP), increased competition,\\nregulatory constraints and financial decisions by governmental authorities. There can be no assurances that we\\nwill be able to stabilize or increase our revenues in the future. Future declines in our revenues could\\nmaterially and adversely impact our ability to execute on our business strategy, comply with our financial\\ncovenants, repay our debts as they become due, negotiate with third parties or attract and retain\\nemployees.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe may be unable to stabilize or grow our revenues and cash flows despite the initiatives we\\nhave implemented.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe must produce adequate revenues and operating cash flows that, when combined with cash on hand and funds available\\nunder our revolving credit facility and other financings, will be sufficient to service our debt, fund our\\ncapital expenditures, pay our taxes, and fund our pension\\nand other employee benefit obligations. We have experienced\\nrevenue declines in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior years. While we have identified potential areas of\\nopportunity and implemented several revenue and cost initiatives, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful or that these initiatives will improve our financial position or our results of\\noperations.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe face intense competition.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe communications industry is extremely competitive. Through mergers and\\nvarious service expansion strategies, service providers are striving to provide integrated solutions both\\nwithin and across geographic markets. Our competitors include competitive local exchange carriers,\\nInternet service providers, wireless companies,\\nOTT, VoIP providers and cable companies, some of which may be\\nsubject to less regulation than we are. These entities may provide services competitive with the services that we\\noffer or intend to introduce. For example, our competitors may seek to introduce networks in our legacy markets\\nthat are competitive with or superior to our copper-based networks in those markets. We also believe that\\nwireless and cable providers have increased their penetration of various services in\\nour markets. We expect that competition will remain robust. Our revenue and cash flow will be adversely\\nimpacted if we cannot reverse our customer losses or continue to provide high-quality services.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe cannot predict which of the many possible future technologies, products\\nor services will be important in order to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be\\nrequired to develop and provide these technologies, products or services. Our ability to compete successfully\\nwill depend on the effectiveness of capital expenditure\\ninvestments in our properties, our marketing efforts, our ability to anticipate and respond to various\\ncompetitive factors affecting the industry, including a changing regulatory environment that may affect our\\nbusiness and that of our competitors differently, new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer\\npreferences, or habits, demographic trends, economic\\nconditions and pricing strategies by competitors. Increasing competition may\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nreduce our revenues and increase our marketing and other costs as well as\\nrequire us to increase our capital expenditures and thereby decrease our cash\\nflows.\\n\\ufeff\\nSome of our competitors have superior resources, which may place us\\nat a disadvantage.\\n\\ufeff\\nSome of our competitors have market presence, engineering, technical,\\nmarketing and financial capabilities, substantially greater than ours. In addition, some of these competitors\\nare able to raise capital at a lower cost than we are able to. Consequently, some of these competitors may be\\nable to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly, adapt more swiftly to\\nnew or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, take advantage of acquisition and other\\nopportunities more readily and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and\\nservices than we will be able to. Additionally, the greater brand name recognition of some competitors may\\nrequire us to price our services at lower levels in order to retain or obtain customers. Finally, the cost\\nadvantages and greater financial resources of some of these\\ncompetitors may give them the ability to reduce their prices for an extended period of time if they so choose.\\nOur business and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted if we are not able to effectively\\ncompete.\\n\\ufeff\\nWeak economic conditions may decrease demand for our services or necessitate increased\\ndiscounts.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe could be adversely impacted by weak economic conditions or their effects.\\nDownturns in the economy and competition in our markets have in the past, and could\\nin the future, cause some of our customers to reduce or eliminate their purchases of\\nour basic and enhanced voice services, broadband and video services and make it difficult for us to obtain new\\ncustomers or retain existing customers. In addition, if economic conditions are depressed or further\\ndeteriorate, our customers may delay or discontinue payment for our services or seek more competitive pricing\\nfrom other service providers, or we may be required to offer increased discounts in order to retain our\\ncustomers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of\\noperations.\\n\\ufeff\\nDisruption in our networks, infrastructure and information technology may cause us to lose\\ncustomers and/or incur additional expenses.\\n\\ufeff\\nTo attract and retain customers, we must provide reliable service. Some of\\nthe risks to our networks, infrastructure and information technology include physical damage, security\\nbreaches, capacity limitations, power surges or outages, software defects and other disruptions beyond our\\ncontrol, such as natural disasters and acts of terrorism. From time to time in the ordinary course of business,\\nwe experience disruptions in our service due to factors such as cable damage, theft of our equipment, inclement\\nweather and service failures of our third-party service providers. We could experience more significant\\ndisruptions in the future. We could also face disruptions due to capacity limitations if changes in our\\ncustomers\\' usage patterns for our broadband services result in a significant increase\\nin capacity utilization, such as through increased usage of video or peer-to-peer file sharing applications. We\\ncould also face disruptions in our networks if third-party providers elect not to continue doing business with\\nus or put their services up for auction and we are not able to retain their services as a result. Disruptions\\nmay cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose\\ncustomers, or increase our operating expense, all of which could adversely affect our business, revenues and\\ncash flows.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur business is sensitive to the creditworthiness of our wholesale customers.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have substantial business relationships with other communications carriers for which we\\nprovide service. While bankruptcies or insolvency of these carriers have not had a material adverse effect on\\nour business in recent years, future bankruptcies or insolvencies in the industry could result in the loss of\\nsignificant customers, as well as cause more price competition and an increased allowance for doubtful accounts\\nreceivable. Such bankruptcies and insolvencies may be more likely in the future if economic conditions\\nstagnate. As a result, our revenues and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\\n\\ufeff\\nA significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions.\\n\\ufeff\\nAs of December 31, 2017, we\\nhad approximately 22,700 employees. Approximately 16,000 of our total employees were represented by unions and were subject to collective bargaining agreements.\\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately\\n1,400 employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expired in\\n2017, but have been extended and are still effective for\\n2018. Of the union-represented employees as of December 31,\\n2017, approximately\\n4,300, or 27%, of\\nthe unionized workforce are covered by collective agreements that expire in\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n2018 and approximately 7,600, or 48%, of the unionized workforce are covered by\\ncollective bargaining agreements that expire in 2019.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe cannot predict the outcome of negotiations of the collective bargaining\\nagreements covering our employees. If we are unable to\\nreach new agreements or renew existing agreements, employees subject to collective bargaining agreements may\\nengage in strikes, work slowdowns or other labor actions, which could materially disrupt our ability to provide\\nservices. New labor agreements or the renewal of existing agreements may impose significant new costs on us,\\nwhich could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the\\nfuture.\\n\\ufeff\\nIf we are unable to hire or retain key personnel, we may be unable to\\noperate our business successfully.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur success will depend in part upon the continued services of our\\nmanagement. We cannot guarantee that our key personnel will not leave or compete with us. The loss, incapacity\\nor unavailability for any reason of key members of our management team could have a material impact on our\\nbusiness. In addition, our financial results and our ability to compete will suffer if we are unable to\\nattract or retain other qualified personnel in the\\nfuture.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn recent years, we have completed multiple acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be\\nable to realize the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies from such\\nacquisitions or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our\\nbalance sheet. We recorded goodwill impairments in 2017 and if our goodwill or other intangible assets become further impaired, we may be required to record additional non-cash charges\\na non-cash charge to earnings and reduce our stockholders\\' equity.\\n\\ufeff\\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, intangible assets are\\nreviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that\\ntheir carrying value may not be recoverable. Frontier monitors relevant circumstances, including general\\neconomic conditions, enterprise value EBITDA multiples for other providers of communications services, our\\noverall financial performance, and the market prices for our stock, and the potential impact that changes in\\nsuch circumstances might have on the valuation of Frontier\\'s goodwill or other intangible assets.\\nAs a result of the continued decline in the share price of our common stock in each of the\\nfour quarters in 2017, we tested goodwill for impairment. Our second and fourth quarter quantitative\\nassessments indicated that the carrying value of the enterprise exceeded its fair value and, therefore, an\\nimpairment existed. We recorded goodwill impairments totaling $2,748 million for 2017.If our goodwill or other intangible assets are determined to be further\\nimpaired in the future, we may be required to record a non-cash charge to earnings during the\\nperiod in which the impairment is determined, which would reduce our stockholders\\' equity.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe may complete a future significant strategic transaction that may not achieve intended\\nresults or could increase the number of our outstanding shares or amount of outstanding debt.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe continuously evaluate and may in the future enter into\\nadditional strategic transactions. Any such transaction\\ncould happen at any time, could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including, for\\nexample, an acquisition, merger or a sale of certain of our\\nassets.\\n\\ufeff\\nEvaluating potential transactions and integrating completed ones may divert\\nthe attention of our management from ordinary operating matters. The success of these potential transactions\\nwill depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies through\\nthe successful integration of the businesses we acquire with our existing business. Even if we are successful\\nin integrating acquired businesses, we cannot assure you that these integrations will result in the realization\\nof the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies or that these benefits will be\\nrealized within the expected time frames. In addition,\\nacquired businesses may have unanticipated liabilities or contingencies.\\n\\ufeff\\nIf we complete an acquisition, investment or other strategic transaction, we\\nmay require additional financing that could result in an increase in the number of our outstanding shares of\\nstock or the aggregate amount and/or cost of our debt, which may result in an adverse\\nimpact to our ratings. The number of shares of our stock or the\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\naggregate principal amount of our debt that we may\\nissue may be significant. Moreover, the terms of any debt financing may be expensive\\nor adversely impact our results of operations.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have in the past and may in the future consider disposing of certain assets or asset groups.\\nWe may not be able to dispose of such assets on terms that are attractive to us, or at all. To the extent we\\nconsummate such a transaction, we may experience operational challenges in segregating such assets.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn the past, we have disposed of assets for a variety of reasons, and we may, from time to\\ntime, consider disposing of other assets or asset groups in the future. We may not be able to dispose of any\\nsuch assets on terms that are attractive to us, or at all, which could adversely impact our financial condition\\nor results of operation. In addition, to the extent we consummate an agreement for the sale and disposition of\\nan asset or asset group, we may experience operational difficulties segregating them from our retained assets\\nand operations, which could impact the execution or timing for such dispositions and could result in\\ndisruptions to our operations and/or claims for damages, among other things.\\n\\ufeff\\nNegotiations with the providers of content for our video systems may not be successful,\\npotentially resulting in our inability to carry certain programming channels on our FiOS and Vantage video\\nsystems, which could result in the loss of subscribers. Alternatively, because of the power of some content\\nproviders, we may be forced to pay an increasing amount for some content, resulting in higher expenses and\\nlower profitability.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe must negotiate with the content owners of the programming that we carry\\non our multichannel video systems (marketed as FiOS video and Vantage video). These content owners are the\\nexclusive provider of the channels they offer. If we are unable to reach a mutually-agreed contract with a\\ncontent owner, including pricing and carriage provisions, our existing agreements to carry this content may not\\nbe renewed, resulting in the blackout of these channels. The loss of content could result in our loss of\\ncustomers who place a high value on the particular content that is lost. In addition, many content providers\\nown multiple channels. As a result, we typically have to negotiate the pricing for multiple channels rather\\nthan one, and carry and pay for content that customers do not value, in order to have access to other content\\nthat customers do value. Some of our competitors have materially larger scale than we\\ndo, and may, as a result, be better positioned than we are in such negotiations. As a result of these factors,\\nthe expense of content acquisition may continue to increase, and this could result in higher expenses and lower\\nprofitability.\\n\\ufeff\\nRisks Related to Liquidity, Financial Resources and Capitalization\\n\\ufeff\\nWe currently have a significant amount of indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, and are\\ncontractually permitted to incur substantial additional indebtedness and grant substantial additional liens in\\nthe future. Such debt and debt service obligations may adversely affect us.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which amounted to $17.9 billion outstanding at\\nDecember 31, 2017, of which $3.6 billion was secured. We also have access to a $850 million secured Revolving\\nCredit Facility, which currently is undrawn.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe terms of our indentures and credit facilities allow us to incur substantial additional\\nindebtedness and grant substantial additional liens in the future. In addition, these terms do not prevent us\\nor our restricted subsidiaries from incurring various types of obligations that do not constitute\\n\"indebtedness\" under these terms.\\n\\ufeff\\nIf we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with our senior notes and\\ndebentures, the holders of that new debt will be entitled to share ratably with holders of our senior notes and\\ndebentures in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization,\\ndissolution or other winding up of Frontier. If any such additional indebtedness is secured, it will be\\neffectively senior to our unsecured senior notes and debentures to the extent of the collateral securing such\\nindebtedness. This may have the effect of reducing the probability of payment, or the amount of proceeds paid,\\nto holders of our senior notes and debentures.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn addition, to the extent other new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\\' current debt\\nlevels, the substantial leverage risks described below would increase.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nThe potential significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of\\noperations that could result from our substantial debt include:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlimitations on our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms or\\nat all;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninstances in which we are unable to comply with the covenants contained in our indentures and\\ncredit agreements or to generate cash sufficient to make required debt payments, which circumstances have the\\npotential of accelerating the maturity of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe possibility that we may trigger the springing maturity provisions in our credit\\nagreements;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe allocation of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt,\\nthus reducing the amount of our cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and\\ndividends that would otherwise improve our competitive position, results of operations or stock price;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrequiring us to issue debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on\\nunfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncompromising our flexibility to plan for, or react to, competitive challenges in our business\\nand the telecommunications industry; and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe possibility of our being put at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who, relative\\nto their size, do not have as much debt as we do, and competitors who may be in a more favorable position to\\naccess additional capital resources.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nIn addition, our senior notes and debentures are rated below \"investment grade\" by independent\\nrating agencies. This has resulted in higher borrowing costs for us. We cannot assure that these rating\\nagencies will not lower our debt ratings further, if in the rating agencies\\' judgment such an action is\\nappropriate. A further lowering of a rating would likely increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our\\naccess to capital. Our negotiations with vendors, customers and business partners can be negatively impacted if\\nthey deem us a credit risk as a result of our credit rating.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe indentures and agreements governing our debt, including our senior notes and debentures and\\nour credit facilities, contain covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries that\\nmay affect our ability to operate our business, make payments on our debt, and pay dividends.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe indentures and agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain covenants that, among\\nother things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nincur additional indebtedness, guarantee indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncreate liens;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nenter into mergers or consolidations, or transfer or sell all or substantially all of our\\nassets;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npay dividends on, or make distributions in respect of, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock,\\nmake certain investments or make other restricted payments;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmake certain asset sales;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nenter into agreements that might prevent certain of our subsidiaries from making distributions,\\nloans or advances to us or other subsidiaries; and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nengage in transactions with affiliates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nIn addition, our credit facilities require us to comply with additional covenants, including\\nfinancial ratios. Any future indebtedness may also require us to comply with similar or other covenants. These\\nrestrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things,\\nlimiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate\\nopportunities.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply\\nwith these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing\\nindentures and agreements could result in a default under those documents and under other agreements containing\\ncross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt and to\\nforeclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds\\nor other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by indentures and\\ncredit agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair\\nour ability to obtain other financing.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier is primarily a holding company and, as a result, we rely on the receipt of funds from\\nour subsidiaries in order to meet our cash needs and service our indebtedness, including our senior notes and\\ndebentures.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier is primarily a holding company and its principal assets consist of the shares of\\ncapital stock or other equity instruments of its subsidiaries. As a holding company, we depend on dividends,\\ndistributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, including those arising under\\nour senior notes and debentures, and meet our cash needs. We cannot assure you that the operating results of\\nour subsidiaries at any given time will be sufficient to make dividends, distributions or other payments to us\\nin order to allow us to make payments on our indebtedness, including our senior notes and debentures. In\\naddition, the payment of these dividends, distributions and other payments, as well as other transfers of\\nassets, between our subsidiaries and from our subsidiaries to us may be subject to legal, regulatory or\\ncontractual restrictions. Some state regulators have imposed and others may consider imposing on regulated\\ncompanies, including us, cash management practices that could limit the ability of such regulated companies to\\ntransfer cash between subsidiaries or to the parent company. While none of the existing state regulations\\nmaterially affects our cash management, any changes to the existing regulations or imposition of new\\nregulations or restrictions may materially adversely affect our ability to transfer cash within our\\nconsolidated companies.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur senior notes and debentures are structurally subordinated to liabilities of our\\nsubsidiaries.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur subsidiaries have not guaranteed our senior notes and debentures. As a\\nresult, holders of such securities will not have any claim as a creditor against our subsidiaries. Accordingly,\\nall obligations of our subsidiaries (including any liens granted by our subsidiaries on any of their assets to\\nsecure any of our obligations) will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be\\navailable for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise. In addition, our subsidiaries may be able to incur\\n$1.4 billion of additional debt (including secured debt),\\nsubject to the contractual limitations in our debt instruments applicable to such subsidiaries. Holders or our\\nsenior notes and debentures would be structurally subordinated to any such future debt as well.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur senior notes and debentures are unsecured and subordinated to any secured indebtedness.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur senior notes and debentures are unsecured and therefore are subordinated to our existing\\nand future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. At\\nDecember 31, 2017, our secured indebtedness consisted of obligations under the JPM Credit Agreement, the CoBank\\nCredit Agreements, the Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Loan B and the Continuing Agreement for Standby Letters\\nof Credit between Frontier and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi UFJ, LTD, each\\nof which is secured by the security package under the JPM Credit Agreement which includes pledges of the equity\\ninterests in certain Frontier subsidiaries and guaranties by certain Frontier subsidiaries. In the event of a\\nbankruptcy or similar proceeding, the assets that serve as collateral for our secured indebtedness will be\\navailable to satisfy the obligations under the secured indebtedness before any payments are made on the senior\\nnotes and debentures from the proceeds of such assets. The indentures governing our senior notes and debentures\\npermit us, subject to specified limitations, to incur a substantial amount of additional secured debt.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt\\nservice obligations to increase.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nAt December 31, 2017, approximately 20% of our total debt is subject to variable rates of\\ninterest. Borrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest\\nrate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness\\nwould increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including\\ncash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. In the future, we may enter into\\ninterest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce\\ninterest rate volatility. However, we might not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our\\nvariable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into might not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe may not have sufficient funds to repurchase our senior notes upon a change of control\\ntriggering event.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe terms of our senior notes require us to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon the\\noccurrence of a Change of Control and Ratings Decline (as defined in the indentures governing the notes) at a\\npurchase price equal to 101% of the respective principal amounts of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest\\nto, but not including, the date of the purchase. It is possible that we would not have sufficient funds at the\\ntime of such a change of control triggering event to make the required repurchase of the applicable series of\\nnotes and would be required to obtain third party financing to do so. We may not be able to obtain this\\nfinancing on commercially reasonable terms, or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the\\noccurrence of certain change of control events may constitute an event of default under the terms of our credit\\nfacilities. Such an event of default would entitle the lenders under our credit facilities to, among other\\nthings, cause all outstanding debt thereunder to become due and payable.\\n\\ufeff\\nAny future payment of dividends on our capital stock will be at the sole discretion of our\\nBoard of Directors and subject to certain important limitations, including legal and contractual\\nrestrictions.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe amount and timing of future dividend payments, if any, on our common stock and Series A\\nPreferred Stock will be made at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors based on factors such as cash\\nflow and cash requirements, capital expenditures requirements, financial condition, covenants in our debt\\ninstruments and legal restrictions. Under Delaware law, our Board of Directors may only declare and pay\\ndividends on shares of our capital stock out of our statutory \"surplus\" (which is the amount equal to total\\nassets minus total liabilities, in each case at fair market value, minus statutory capital), or if there is no\\nsuch surplus, out of our net profits for the then current or immediately preceding fiscal year. In addition,\\nour ability to declare and pay dividends is restricted by our existing financing arrangements and may be\\nrestricted by future financing arrangements. For example, our credit agreements prohibit us from using proceeds\\nfrom our revolving credit facility to fund dividend payments if the undrawn amount under the revolver is less\\nthan $250 million, and we may not pay dividends on our common stock in excess of $2.40 per share in any fiscal\\nyear. As such, there can be no assurances that we will declare and pay any future dividends on our capital\\nstock.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe expect to make contributions to our pension plan in future years, the\\namount of which will be impacted by volatility in asset values related to Frontier\\'s\\npension plan and/or changes in pension plan assumptions.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier made contributions of $75 million, net of the Differential payment received (See note\\n17), and $28 million to its pension plan in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and we expect to continue to make\\ncontributions in future years. Volatility in our asset values, liability calculations, or returns may impact\\nthe costs of maintaining our pension plan and our future funding requirements. Any future material contribution\\ncould have a negative impact on our liquidity by reducing cash flows.\\n\\ufeff\\nSignificant changes in discount rates, rates of return on pension assets, mortality tables and\\nother factors could adversely affect our earnings and equity and increase our pension funding requirements.\\n\\ufeff\\nPension costs and obligations are determined using actual results as well as actuarial\\nvaluations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the long-term\\nexpected return on assets and mortality tables. Other assumptions include salary increases and retirement age.\\nSome of these\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nassumptions, such as the discount rate and return on pension assets, are reflective of economic\\nconditions and largely out of our control. Changes in the pension assumptions could adversely affect our\\nearnings, equity and funding requirements.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\nRisks Related to Regulation and Oversight\\n\\ufeff\\nChanges in federal or\\nstate regulations may reduce the switched access charge revenues we receive.\\n\\ufeff\\nA portion of Frontier\\'s total revenues ($165 million, or 2%, in 2017 and\\n$170 million, or 2%, in 2016) are derived from switched access charges paid by other carriers for services\\nwe provide in originating intrastate and interstate\\nlong-distance traffic. Frontier expects a portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from switched\\naccess charges paid by these carriers for these services. The rates Frontier can charge for switched access are\\nregulated by the FCC and state regulatory\\nagencies.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn 2011, the FCC adopted the 2011 Order regarding Intercarrier Compensation, which is the\\npayment framework that governs how carriers compensate each other for the exchange of voice traffic between\\ncarriers. The 2011 Order began a multi-year transition that moves the rate for terminating traffic to near zero\\nby 2017, with the final phase down of a subset of traffic in 2018. Additionally, the 2011 Order requires VoIP\\nproviders to pay interstate terminating interconnection charges and requires all carriers terminating traffic\\nto provide appropriate call information, thus prohibiting so-called \"phantom traffic.\" The FCC also reformed\\nthe Universal Service Fund in this order to shift the High-Cost portion of the fund from supporting voice\\nservices to supporting broadband deployment in high-cost areas.\\n\\ufeff\\nHowever, the 2011 Order did not resolve all questions on Intercarrier Compensation. The FCC\\ncontinues to consider the possibility of transitioning originating access rates in the future. We cannot\\npredict when or how the FCC would implement any changes originating access rates, and future reductions in\\nthese revenues may directly affect our profitability and cash flows as these regulatory revenues do not have an\\nequal level of associated variable expenses.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn August 2017, the FCC decision to deregulate the\\nmarket for special access services where the market is determined to be competitive and the transport market\\nnationwide became effective. Some aspects of that decision are under appeal by stakeholders.\\nWe cannot predict the outcome of that appeal or the impact of\\nfuture changes on our results or operations.\\n\\ufeff\\nCertain states also have their own open proceedings to address reform to originating intrastate\\naccess charges, other intercarrier compensation, and state universal service funds. Although the FCC has\\npre-empted state jurisdiction on most access charges, many states could consider moving forward with their\\nproceedings. We cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or\\nswitched access revenues. However, future reductions in our subsidy or switched access revenues may directly\\naffect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have an equal level of associated\\nvariable expenses.\\n\\ufeff\\nA portion of Frontier\\'s revenues are derived from federal and state subsidies. To the extent\\nthe federal or any state government reduces such subsidies, our operating income could be materially and\\nadversely impacted.\\n\\ufeff\\nA portion of Frontier\\'s total revenues ($395 million, or 4%, in 2017 and $409 million, or 5%,\\nin 2016) are derived from federal and state subsidies for rural and high-cost support, that consists of CAF II\\nsupport, Federal High Cost support, and various state subsidies. The FCC\\'s 2011 Order changed how federal\\nsubsidies are calculated and disbursed. These changes transitioned the USF (Universal Service Fund), which\\nsupported voice services in high-cost areas, to the CAF (Connect America Fund), which supports broadband\\ndeployment in high-cost areas. Federal subsidies represented approximately 92% of subsidy revenue in 2017 and\\n89% in 2016, with the remainder being state subsidies.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier is required to contribute to the Universal Service Fund. The FCC allows Frontier to\\nrecover these contributions through a USF Surcharge on customers\\' bills. This surcharge accounted for $216\\nmillion of revenue in 2017 and $217 million in 2016.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nFuture reductions in these subsidies, or in our ability to recover Universal Service Fund\\ncontributions, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier and our industry will likely remain highly regulated, and we could incur substantial\\ncompliance costs that could constrain our ability to compete in our target markets.\\n\\ufeff\\nAs an incumbent local exchange carrier, some of the services we offer are subject to\\nsignificant regulation from federal, state and local authorities. This regulation could impact our ability to\\nchange our rates, especially on our basic voice services and our access rates, and could impose substantial\\ncompliance costs on us. In some jurisdictions, regulation may restrict our ability to expand our service\\nofferings. In addition, changes to the regulations that govern our business (including any implementation of\\nthe 2011 Order) may have an adverse effect on our business by reducing the allowable fees that we may charge,\\nimposing additional compliance costs, reducing the amount of subsidies or otherwise changing the nature of our\\noperations and the competition in our industry. At this time, it is unknown how these regulations will affect\\nFrontier\\'s operations or ability to compete in the future.\\n\\ufeff\\nOther FCC rulemakings and state regulatory proceedings, including those relating to\\nintercarrier compensation, universal service and broadband services, could have a substantial adverse impact on\\nour operations.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn December 2017, the FCC voted to roll back the FCC\\'s 2015 Order applying the Title II\\nframework to broadband services. This decision restores the light touch regulatory treatment of broadband\\nservice in place prior to 2015 and preserves the FCC\\'s transparency requirements. The decision also clarifies\\nthat the Federal Trade Commission is the proper venue for enforcement of the transparency requirements and\\nprivacy practices. Several parties are expected to appeal this order and may seek a stay of its provisions.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur Internet access offerings could become subject to additional laws and regulations as they\\nare adopted or applied to the Internet. As the significance of the Internet expands, federal, state and local\\ngovernments may pass laws and adopt rules and regulations, including those directed at privacy, or apply\\nexisting laws and regulations to the Internet (including Internet access services), and related matters are\\nunder consideration in both federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies. Although the FCC has\\npre-empted state jurisdiction on network neutrality and privacy, many states could consider moving forward with\\nlegislation on these or other Internet-related issues. At least two states, Montana and New York have already\\ntaken executive action directed at reinstating aspects of the FCC\\'s 2015 Order. We cannot predict whether the\\noutcome of expected or pending challenges to the FCC\\'s order or future proceedings will prove beneficial or\\ndetrimental to our competitive position.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe are subject to the oversight of certain federal and state agencies that have in the past,\\nand may in the future, investigate or pursue enforcement actions against us relating to consumer protection\\nmatters.\\n\\ufeff\\nCertain federal and state agencies, including state attorneys general, monitor and exercise\\noversight related to consumer protection matters, including those affecting the communications industry. Such\\nagencies have in the past, and may in the future, choose to launch an inquiry or investigation of our business\\npractices in response to customer complaints or other publicized customer service issues or disruptions. Such\\ninquiries or investigations could result in reputational harm, enforcement actions, litigation, fines,\\nsettlements and/or operational and financial conditions being placed on the company, any of which could\\nmaterially and adversely affect our business.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nTax legislation may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\\n\\ufeff\\nTax laws are dynamic and continually change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of\\nthe law are issued or applied. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation\\ncommonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA). The TCJA makes broad and complex changes to the\\nU.S. tax code and, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant\\nadditional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and\\nimposes limitations on the use of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31,\\n2017. The reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate results in a decreased valuation of our deferred tax asset\\nand liabilities. The overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial\\ncondition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will\\nconform to the newly enacted federal tax law. The determination of the benefit from (provision for) income\\ntaxes requires complex estimations, significant judgments and significant knowledge and experience concerning\\nthe applicable tax laws. Given that we are still in the transition period for the accounting for income tax\\neffects of the TCJA, the current assessment on deferred tax assets (liabilities) is based on the currently\\navailable information and guidance. If in the future any element of the tax reform changes the related\\naccounting guidance for income tax, it could affect our income tax position and we may need to adjust the\\nbenefit from (provision for) income taxes accordingly.\\n\\ufeff\\nRisks Related to Technology\\n\\ufeff\\nWe may be unable to meet the technological needs or expectations of our customers, and may lose\\ncustomers as a result.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to significant changes in technology, and replacing\\nor upgrading our infrastructure to keep pace with such technological changes could result in significant\\ncapital expenditures. If we do not replace or upgrade technology and equipment and manage broadband speeds and\\ncapacity as necessary, we may be unable to compete effectively because we will not be able to meet the needs or\\nexpectations of our customers.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn addition, enhancements to product offerings may influence our customers to consider other\\nservice providers, such as cable operators or wireless providers. We may be unable to attract new or retain\\nexisting customers from cable companies due to their deployment of enhanced broadband and VoIP technology. In\\naddition, new capacity services for wireless broadband technologies may permit our competitors to offer\\nbroadband data services to our customers throughout most or all of our service areas. Any resulting inability\\nto attract new or retain existing customers could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a\\nmaterial manner.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe rely on network and information systems and other technology, and a disruption or failure of\\nsuch networks, systems or technology as a result of computer viruses, cyber-attacks, misappropriation of data\\nor other malfeasance, as well as outages, accidental releases of information or similar events, may disrupt our\\nbusiness and materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe maintain security measures, disaster recovery plans and business continuity plans for our\\nbusiness and are continuously working to upgrade our existing technology systems and provide employee training\\naround the cyber risks we face. Nevertheless, our information technology networks and infrastructure may be\\nsubject to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, cyber-attacks or breaches, employee or\\nthird-party error or malfeasance, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures,\\nnatural disasters or other catastrophic events.\\n\\ufeff\\nFurther, our network and information systems are subject to various risks\\nrelated to third parties and other parties we may not fully control. We use encryption and authentication\\ntechnology licensed from third parties to provide secure transmission of confidential information, including\\nour business data and customer information. Similarly, we rely on employees in our network operations centers,\\ndata centers, call centers and retail stores to follow our procedures when handling sensitive information.\\nWhile we select our third-party business partners and employees carefully, we do not always control their\\nactions, which could expose us to cyber-security risks. In addition, our customers\\nusing our network to access the Internet may become victim to malicious and abusive Internet activities, such\\nas unsolicited mass advertising (or spam), peer-to-peer file sharing, distribution of viruses, worms and other\\ndestructive or disruptive software; these activities could adversely affect our network, result in excessive\\ncall volume at our call centers and damage our or our customers\\' equipment and data.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nAny unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional release\\nof confidential information or other disruptions could result in misappropriation of our or our customers\\'\\nsensitive information; reputational harm; increased costs, such as those relating to remediation or future\\nprotection; customer dissatisfaction, which could lead to a decline in customers and revenue; and legal claims\\nor proceedings, fines and other liabilities.

Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\nIntroduction\\n\\ufeff\\n(a) Results of Operations\\n\\ufeff\\n2017 Compared to 2016\\n\\ufeff\\nOn April 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Verizon\\'s wireline\\nproperties in California, Texas, and Florida (the CTF Acquisition, of the CTF Operations). Frontier\\'s scope of operations and balance sheet changed materially as a result of the completion of the\\nCTF Acquisition. Historical financial and operating data presented for Frontier includes the results of the CTF\\nOperations that were acquired in the CTF Acquisition from the date of acquisition on April 1,\\n2016. As a result our financial results for 2017 include CTF\\nOperations for the full year of 2017, while financial results for 2016 only included CTF Operations for the\\nfinal nine months of 2016.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn July 10, 2017, we effected a one for fifteen reverse stock split of our common stock. The\\nreverse stock split reduced the number of common shares issued (which includes outstanding shares and treasury\\nshares) from approximately 1,193,000,000 shares to 80,000,000 shares, and reduced shares outstanding from\\n1,178,000,000 shares to 79,000,000 shares. In addition, and at the same time, the total number of shares of\\ncommon stock that Frontier is authorized to issue changed from 1,750,000,000 shares to 175,000,000 shares.\\nThere was no change in the par value of the common stock, and no fractional shares were issued. All share and\\nper share amounts in the financial discussion below have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented\\nto give effect to the reverse stock split. As a result of our reverse stock split the conversion rates of our\\nSeries A Preferred Stock were proportionately adjusted.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\nThe sections below include tables that present customer counts, average\\nmonthly consumer revenue per customer (ARPC) and consumer customer churn.\\nWe define churn as the number of\\nconsumer customer deactivations during the month divided by\\nthe number of consumer customers at the beginning of the month and utilize the average\\nof each monthly churn in the period.\\n\\ufeff\\nManagement believes that consumer customer counts and average monthly revenue per customer are\\nimportant factors in evaluating our consumer customer trends. Among the key services we provide to consumer\\ncustomers are voice service, data service and video service. We continue to explore the potential to provide\\nadditional services to our customer base, with the objective of meeting all of our customers\\' communications\\nneeds.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following should be read in conjunction with Item 7. \"Management\\'s\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included in our Annual Report on Form\\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs of or for the year ended\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDecember 31, 2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n% Increase (Decrease)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomers (in thousands)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4,850\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5,393\\n\\n\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConsumer customer metrics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomers (in thousands)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4,397\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4,891\\n\\n\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNet customer additions/(losses)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(494)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,767\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n(128)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage monthly consumer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrevenue per customer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n80.96\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n77.47\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomer monthly churn\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.17%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.98%\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommercial customer metrics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomers (in thousands)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n453\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n502\\n\\n\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBroadband subscriber metrics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(in thousands)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBroadband subscribers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3,938\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4,271\\n\\n\\n\\n(8)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNet subscriber additions/(losses)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(333)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,809\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n(118)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVideo (excl.

As of December 31, 2017, 67% of our consumer broadband customers were subscribed to at least one other service offering.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe had approximately 4.4 million and 4.9 million total consumer customers as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our\\naverage monthly consumer customer churn was 2.17% for the year ended December 31, 2017 (1.91% for Frontier legacy and 2.56% for CTF Operations) compared to 1.98%\\n(1.76% for Frontier legacy and 2.46% for CTF Operations) for 2016. The consolidated\\naverage monthly consumer revenue per customer (consumer ARPC) increased by $3.49 or 5% to $80.96 during 2017\\ncompared to the prior year. The overall increase in consumer ARPC is a result of the increased revenue provided\\nby a full year of CTF operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016. This\\nincrease was partially offset by a decrease in video services.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe had approximately 453,000 and 502,000 total commercial customers as of\\nDecember 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We lost approximately 49,000 commercial customers during the year\\nended December 31, 2017 compared to an increase of 213,000 customers for the prior year. Frontier expects the\\ndeclines in voice services revenue and wireless backhaul revenues from commercial customers to continue in\\n2018. Our Ethernet product revenues from our SME (small business, medium business and\\nlarger enterprise customers) and carrier customers grew 11% for the Frontier legacy operations during 2017, compared to the prior year\\nperiod. The prior year increase in customers was driven by 250,000 new customers\\nacquired from Verizon in the CTF Acquisition.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe had approximately 3.9 million and 4.3 million\\nbroadband subscribers as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017,\\nwe lost approximately 333,000 net broadband subscribers\\ncompared to an increase of 1,809,000 for the prior year. The prior year increase\\nin subscribers was driven by 2,052,000 new subscribers acquired from Verizon in the CTF Acquisition.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe offer video services to certain of our customers under the\\nFiOS® brand in portions of California, Texas,\\nFlorida, Indiana, Oregon, and Washington, and under the\\nVantage brand in portions of Connecticut, North Carolina, South Carolina,\\nMinnesota, Illinois, New York, and Ohio. We\\nalso offer satellite TV video service to our customers under an agency relationship with\\nDISH® in all of our markets.

This increase was partially offset by\\ndecreased voice and data and Internet services revenues driven by a decline in\\ncustomers.\\n\\ufeff\\nConsolidated customer revenue increased $93 million due to consumer customer\\nrevenue and $160 million due to commercial customer revenues. The increase in consumer customer revenue was\\nprimarily due additional revenue provided by a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months\\nin 2016. This increase was partially offset by decreases in voice, data and internet,\\nand video services revenue. We have experienced declines in\\nthe number of traditional voice customers and switched access minutes of use as a result of competition and the\\navailability of substitutes, a trend we expect to continue. The increase in consolidated commercial customer revenue was primarily driven by additional revenue provided\\nby a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016. This increase was partially\\noffset by decreases in our voice services revenue and nonswitched revenue including\\nwireless backhaul revenue and decreased revenues related to our Frontier Secure Strategic\\nPartnerships business which was sold in May 2017.\\n\\ufeff\\nConsolidated switched access and subsidy revenue represented\\n9% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. Switched\\naccess revenue was $165 million for the year ended December\\n31, 2017, or 2% of our revenues, which decreased from\\n$170 million, or 2% of our revenues, in the prior year period. The decrease was driven by reduced\\nrates which were mandated by the 2011 Order with a related decline in operating\\nexpenses. Subsidy revenue, including CAF Phase II subsidies, was $611 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 7% of our revenues, which decreased from $626\\nmillion, or 7% of our revenues, in the\\nprior year period.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nWe categorize our products, services, and other revenues into the following five\\ncategories:\\n\\ufeff\\nData and Internet Services\\nData and internet services include broadband services for consumer and\\ncommercial customers. We also provide data transmission\\nservices to high volume commercial customers and other carriers with dedicated high capacity circuits\\n(\"nonswitched access\") including services to wireless providers (\"wireless backhaul\").\\n\\ufeff\\nConsolidated data and Internet services revenue for the year ended December\\n31, 2017 increased $169 million as compared with 2016.\\nConsolidated data services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased\\n$81 million, or 4%, to $2,240 million due to the additional revenue\\nprovided by a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016. This increase was\\npartially offset by a reduction in revenue as a result of the sale of the Frontier\\nSecure Strategic Partnerships business in May 2017 and a decrease in the total number of broadband\\nsubscribers. Consolidated nonswitched access revenues for the year ended December 31,\\n2017 increased $88 million, or 6%, to $1,622 million as\\ncompared with 2016 due to additional revenue provided by a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only\\nnine months in 2016. This increase was partially offset by lower monthly recurring\\nrevenue for wireless backhaul and other carrier services. We expect wireless data\\nusage to continue to increase, which may drive the need for additional wireless backhaul capacity. Despite the\\nneed for additional capacity, in the near term, we anticipate that our overall wireless backhaul revenues\\n(which comprise approximately 3% of consolidated total revenues) will continue to decline in 2018, as our\\ncarrier customers migrate to Ethernet solutions at lower price points or migrate to\\nour competitors.\\n\\ufeff\\nVoice Services\\nVoice services include traditional local and long-distance wireline services, data-based Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)\\nservices, as well as voice messaging services offered to our consumer and commercial customers. Voice services\\nalso include the long-distance voice origination and\\ntermination services that we provide to our commercial customers and other carriers.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe decrease of $22\\nmillion in voice services revenue was primarily due to the continued\\nloss of voice customers and decreases in long-distance\\nrevenue among those customers that do not have a bundled long-distance plan, which was partially offset by additional revenues resulting from\\na full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016.\\n\\ufeff\\nVideo Services\\nVideo services include revenues generated from\\nservices provided directly to consumer customers through the FiOS video and Vantage video brands, and through\\nDISH satellite TV services.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe increase of $60 million\\nin video services revenue was primarily due to additional revenue provided by a full\\nyear of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016. The increase was partially offset\\nby reduced revenue resulting from a decrease in the total number of video\\nsubscribers.\\n\\ufeff\\nOther\\nOther customer revenue includes sales of customer premise equipment to our commercial customers\\nand directory services, less our provision for bad debts.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe increase of $46 million in other revenue was\\nprimarily due to a decrease in uncollectibles, which was partially offset by a\\ndecrease in maintenance contracts.\\n\\ufeff\\nSwitched Access and Subsidy\\nSwitched access and subsidy revenues include revenues derived from allowing\\nother carriers to use our network to originate and/or terminate their local and long-distance voice traffic (\"switched access\"). These services are primarily billed\\non a minutes-of-use basis applying tariffed rates filed with the FCC or state agencies. We also receive cost\\nsubsidies from state and federal authorities, including the Connect America Fund.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe decrease of $21 million in switched access and subsidy revenue was primarily due to decreases in subsidies from the state high cost, offset by additional revenue provided by a full year of\\nCTF Operations in 2017 compared to 2016.

Our second and\\nfourth quarter quantitative assessments indicated that the carrying value of the enterprise exceeded its fair\\nvalue and, therefore, an impairment existed. We recorded goodwill impairments totaling $2,748 million for 2017.\\nThe driver for the impairment in the second quarter was a reduction in our profitability and utilized EBITDA\\nestimate, which when applied to our market multiple resulted in a lower enterprise valuation. During the fourth\\nquarter, the impairment was largely driven by a lower enterprise valuation resulting from a reduction in\\nutilized market multiple from 5.8x to 5.5x reflecting the lower outlook for our industry as a whole. The\\nrevaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities which resulted from the enactment of Tax Cut and Job Act,\\ncaused further goodwill impairment. Further declines in our profitability or share\\nprice could result in additional impairment in the future.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the year ended December 31,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$ Increase\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n% Increase\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n($ in millions)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Decrease)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Decrease)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAcquisition and integration costs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n436\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n(411)\\n\\n\\n\\n(94)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nAcquisition costs include financial advisory, accounting, regulatory, legal and other related\\ncosts.

Unless otherwise noted, the variance explanations discussed below\\nare based upon an analysis of the 2016 financial data for Frontier legacy operations (excluding the CTF\\nOperations) in comparison to 2015.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe sections below include tables that present customer counts, average monthly revenue per\\ncustomer (ARPC) and consumer customer churn which we define as the average of the amount of consumer customer\\ndeactivations during the month divided by the number of consumer customers at the beginning of the month. The\\nfollowing also categorizes revenue into customer revenue (consumer and commercial) and regulatory revenue\\n(switched access and subsidy). The decline in the number of customers was partially offset by increased\\npenetration of additional higher revenue generating products and services sold to both consumer and commercial\\ncustomers, which has increased our average monthly revenue per customer in 2016 as compared to 2015. Similar to\\nother wireline providers, we have experienced declines in the number of traditional voice customers, switched\\naccess minutes of use and rates per switched access minute of use, due to the FCC\\'s intercarrier compensation\\nreform, as a result of competition and the availability of substitutes, a trend which we expect will\\ncontinue.\\n\\ufeff\\nManagement believes that consumer customer counts and average monthly revenue per customer are\\nimportant factors in evaluating our consumer customer trends. Among the key services we provide to consumer\\ncustomers are voice service, data service and video service.

As of December 31, 2016,\\n63% of our consumer broadband\\ncustomers were subscribed to at least one other service offering.\\n\\ufeff\\nDuring 2016, we gained approximately 2.0 million customers, net, as compared\\nto a loss of 96,000 customers, net, in 2015. Although we added approximately 2.5 million customers in 2016\\nfollowing the CTF Acquisition, we lost a net of approximately 553,000 customers across all of our markets.\\nThese customer losses were more heavily weighted in the newly acquired CTF markets due to transition\\ndisruptions following the acquisition, resulting in higher than normal customer churn, as well as the\\nsuspension of collection activities prior to and after the closing of the CTF Acquisition, and the suspension\\nof marketing efforts for a period of time following the acquisition. These actions resulted in fewer additions\\nthan would otherwise have been achieved.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe had approximately 4.9 million and 3.1\\nmillion total consumer customers as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively Although we added approximately 2.3 million total consumer customers attributable to the CTF\\nAcquisition in 2016, we lost approximately 516,000 consumer customers, net, during 2016, composed of losses in both our legacy\\nmarkets and in the CTF markets, principally driven by declines in voice customers. Our consumer\\ncustomer monthly churn was 1.98% for 2016.\\nAverage monthly consumer revenue per customer\\n(consumer ARPC) increased $13.54, or\\n21%, to $77.47 during 2016 as compared to 2015. The overall increase in\\nconsumer ARPC is a result of higher video revenue from our CTF\\nOperations and improvements in data services revenue for our legacy operations, partially offset by\\nlower voice services revenue. We expect to improve our video and\\ndata subscriber trends for our Frontier legacy and CTF operations. We anticipate continuing declines in voice\\nservices revenue as fewer consumer customers subscribe to\\nlandline voice services.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe had approximately\\n0.5 million and 0.3 million total commercial customers as of December 31, 2016 and\\n2015, respectively.

Average monthly commercial revenue per customer (commercial ARPC)\\ndecreased $17.16, or 2%, to $673.72 during\\n2016 as compared to 2015. The commercial ARPC decrease is\\nprimarily attributable to our CTF markets having lower ARPC per SME (small business, medium business and larger\\nenterprise customers) customer and proportionally fewer wholesale customers relative to total\\ncommercial customers as compared to our legacy markets.\\nWe have seen modest increases in our revenues from small/medium/enterprise (SME) customers\\nthroughout 2016, and our Ethernet product revenues from our SME and carrier customers has grown by 8% for the\\nFrontier legacy operations during 2016.\\n\\ufeff\\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1.8 million more broadband\\nsubscribers than we did at December 31, 2015. We added 2,052,000 subscribers as part of the CTF Acquisition;\\nhowever, we lost approximately 243,000 net subscribers, primarily due to fewer gross activations and higher\\ncustomer churn. At December 31, 2016, 57% of our consolidated consumer broadband customers subscribed to speeds in excess of our 6 Mbps basic speed tier, up from 29% at December 31,\\n2015.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe offer video services under the Vantage brand to our customers in\\nConnecticut, South Carolina, Minnesota, and Illinois and under the FiOS®\\nbrand in California, Texas, and Florida (and on a limited basis in Indiana, Oregon and\\nWashington).

Similar to other wireline providers, we have experienced declines in the\\nnumber of traditional voice customers and switched access\\nminutes of use as a result of competition and the availability of substitutes, a trend we expect to continue.\\nThe consolidated monthly average revenue per customer (ARPC) for our consumer customers increased 21% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015.

The consolidated ARPC for our commercial\\ncustomers decreased 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared with 2015.\\nThe commercial ARPC decrease is primarily attributable to our\\nCTF markets having lower ARPC per SME (small business, medium business and larger enterprise customers)\\ncustomer and proportionally fewer wholesale customers relative to total business customers as compared to our\\nlegacy markets.\\n\\ufeff\\nConsolidated switched access and subsidy revenue of $797 million represented 9% of our revenues\\nfor 2016. Switched access revenue was $170 million in 2016, or 2% of our revenues, down from $177 million, or\\n3% of our revenues, in 2015. The Report and Order released by the FCC on November 18, 2011 (the 2011 Order)\\nprovided for the gradual elimination of terminating traffic charges by 2017. Switched access revenue declined\\nsequentially in the third quarter of 2016, reflecting the rate reductions mandated by the 2011 Order, and we\\nanticipate that we have experienced nearly all of the rate decline related to the 2011 Order. We have been able\\nto recover a significant portion of these lost revenues through end user rates and other replacement support\\nmechanisms, a trend we expect will continue throughout 2017. We expect declining revenue trends in switched\\naccess revenue to continue in 2017 in our legacy operations. Subsidy revenue, including CAF Phase II subsidies,\\nwas $626 million in 2016, or 7% of our revenues, which increased from $500 million, or 9% of our revenues, in\\n2015.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe categorize our products, services and other revenues among the following five\\ncategories:\\n\\ufeff\\nVoice Services\\nVoice services revenue for 2016 decreased as compared with 2015, primarily due\\nto the continued loss of voice customers and, to a lesser extent, decreases in individual feature packages, as\\nwell as long-distance revenue among those customers that do\\nnot have a bundled long-distance plan, partially offset by\\nincreased local voice charges to consumer and\\ncommercial end users.\\n\\ufeff\\nData and Internet Services\\nData and Internet services revenue for 2016 decreased as compared with 2015. Data services\\nrevenues for 2016 increased $45 million, or 3%, primarily due to higher Frontier Secure revenues. Nonswitched\\naccess revenues decreased $55 million, or 6%, primarily due to lower monthly recurring revenues for wireless\\nbackhaul and other carrier services. We expect wireless data usage to continue to increase, which may drive the\\nneed for additional wireless backhaul capacity.\\n\\ufeff\\nVideo Services\\nVideo services for 2016 decreased primarily due to a decrease in the total number of video\\nsubscribers.\\n\\ufeff\\nOther\\nOther revenues for 2016 decreased primarily due to lower directory services revenue.\\n\\ufeff\\nSwitched Access and Subsidy\\nSwitched access and subsidy revenue for 2016 decreased as compared to 2015.\\nSubsidy revenues decreased $16 million, or 3% in 2016, primarily attributable to\\nthe one-time true-up payments and phasedown support recognized in 2015 in connection\\nwith the CAF Phase II program. Switched access revenue\\ndecreased $39 million, or 22%, in 2016 primarily due to the impact of the decline in minutes of use related to\\naccess line losses and the displacement of minutes of use by wireless and other communications services,\\ncombined with the lower rates enacted by the FCC\\'s intercarrier compensation.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n40\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n2016 OPERATING EXPENSES COMPARED TO 2015\\n\\ufeff\\nNETWORK ACCESS EXPENSE\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrontier Legacy (excluding CTF Operations)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConsolidated\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCTF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$ Increase\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n% Increase\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n($ in millions)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmount\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOperations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmount\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Decrease)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Decrease)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmount\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNetwork access expenses\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,470\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n852\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n618\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n(22)\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n640\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nNetwork access expenses include access charges and other third-party costs directly\\nattributable to connecting customer locations to our network and video content costs.

Our primary source of funds during 2017\\nwas cash generated from operations, restricted and unrestricted cash, and additional\\nborrowings. In 2017, we used cash flow from operations,\\nrestricted cash, and cash on hand to principally fund all of our cash investing and financing\\nactivities, primarily capital expenditures, dividends, and\\ndebt repayments. On April 1, 2016, we used the restricted cash obtained from net proceeds of the September 2015\\nsenior notes offering and June 2015 equity offerings, along with additional borrowings and cash on hand, to\\nfinance the CTF Acquisition.\\n\\ufeff\\nAt December 31, 2017, we had a working capital deficit of $1,185 million, including $656 million of long-term debt\\ndue within one year, as compared to a working capital deficit of $788 million at December 31, 2016.\\nThe decline in working capital is primarily due to an increase in long term debt due within\\none year of $293 million as compared to the prior year related to senior notes reaching maturity during 2018.\\nAlthough we have a working capital deficit as of December 31, 2017, after deducting current debt maturities,\\nthe majority of the balance relates to current advanced billings of $270 million that will be recognized as\\nrevenue over the next twelve months.\\n\\ufeff\\nCash Flows provided by Operating Activities\\n\\ufeff\\nCash flows provided by operating activities increased $174 million, or 10%, to $1,850 million in\\n2017 as compared to 2016.

A number of\\nfactors, including but not limited to, losses of customers, pricing pressure from increased\\ncompetition, lower subsidy and switched access revenues, and the impact of economic\\nconditions may negatively affect our cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2017, we had $656\\nmillion and $804 million of debt maturing in 2018 and 2019, respectively.\\n\\ufeff\\nTerm Loan and Credit Facilities\\nOn February 27, 2017, Frontier entered into a first amended and restated\\ncredit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto,\\npursuant to which Frontier combined its revolving credit agreement, dated as of June 2, 2014, and its term loan\\ncredit agreement, dated as of August 12, 2015. Under the JPM Credit Agreement, as further amended on June 15,\\n2017 by Increase Joinder No.1 (as so amended, the JPM Credit Agreement), Frontier has a $1,625 million senior\\nsecured term loan A facility (the Term Loan A) maturing on March 31, 2021, an $850 million undrawn secured\\nrevolving credit facility maturing on February 27, 2022 (the Revolver), and $1,500 million senior secured term\\nloan B facility (the Term Loan B) maturing on June 15, 2024. The determination of interest rates for each of\\nthe facilities under the JPM Credit Agreement is based on margins over the Base Rate (as defined in the JPM\\nCredit Agreement) or over LIBOR, at the election of Frontier. Interest rate margins on the Term Loan A and\\nRevolver (ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% for Base Rate borrowings and 1.75% to 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings) are\\nsubject to adjustment based on Frontier\\'s Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement). The\\ninterest rate on the Term Loan A as of December 31, 2017 was LIBOR plus 2.75%. Interest rate margins on the\\nTerm Loan B (2.75% for Base Rate borrowings and 3.75% for LIBOR borrowings) are not subject to adjustment.

Letters of credit issued under the revolver totaled $63 million and $0 as of December 31, 2017 and\\n2016, respectively. The revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes but may not be\\nused to fund dividend payments if the undrawn amount under the revolver is less than\\n$250 million.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier has two senior secured credit agreements with CoBank, ACB, as administrative agent,\\nlead arranger and a lender, and the other lenders party thereto: the first, drawn in 2011 (the 2011 CoBank\\nCredit Agreement), was refinanced on October 12, 2016 with a similar facility for $315 million, maturing on\\nOctober 12, 2021 (the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement), and the second, drawn in 2014 (the 2014 CoBank Credit\\nAgreement), matures on October 24, 2019.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn March 29, 2017, Frontier amended the 2014 and 2016 CoBank Credit Agreements. The amendments\\nprovide that interest rate margins under each of these facilities will range from 0.875% to 3.875% for Base\\nRate borrowings and 1.875% to 4.875% for LIBOR borrowings, subject to adjustment based on our Total Leverage\\nRatio, as defined in each credit agreement. The interest rate on each of the facilities as of December 31, 2017\\nwas LIBOR plus 3.875%. In addition, the amendments provide for increases in the maximum Leverage Ratio and\\nexpansion of the security package identical to those contained in the JPM Credit Agreement.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn January 25, 2018 Frontier further amended its credit agreements with JP\\nMorgan Chase and CoBank (JPM Credit Amendment). The\\namendments expand the security package to include interests of certain subsidiaries previously not pledged\\nand also update the net leverage ratio maintenance test\\ncovenant, which provides Frontier with greater flexibility in executing on operational\\ninitiatives going forward, as detailed in the section below.\\n\\ufeff\\nLetters of Credit Facility\\nFrontier has a Continuing Agreement for Standby Letters of Credit with\\nDeutsche Bank AG New York Branch and Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi UFJ, LTD. (the LC Agreements), Frontier can\\nalso issue letters of credit under the revolver up to a maximum of $134 million. As of December 31, 2017, $129\\nmillion and $63 million of undrawn Standby Letters of Credit had been issued under the LC\\nAgreements and revolver respectively. Borrowings under the LC\\nAgreements are secured by a security package identical to\\nthose contained in the JPM Credit Amendment.\\n\\ufeff\\nCovenants\\nThe terms and conditions contained in our indentures, the CoBank Credit Agreements, and the JPM\\nCredit Agreement include the timely payment of principal and interest when due, the maintenance of our\\ncorporate existence, keeping proper books and records in accordance with GAAP, restrictions on the incurrence\\nof liens on our assets securing indebtedness and our subsidiaries\\' assets, restrictions on the incurrence of\\nindebtedness by our subsidiaries and restrictions on asset sales and transfers, mergers and other changes in\\ncorporate control subject to important qualifications and exceptions. We would be restricted from declaring\\ndividends by the CoBank Credit Agreements and the JPM Credit Agreement if an event of default occurred and was\\ncontinuing at the time or would result from the dividend declaration. In addition, under the Certificate of\\nDesignations of our 11.125% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, we would be restricted from paying\\ndividends on our common stock if we failed to declare and pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe JPM Credit Amendment\\nreplaced Frontiers existing net leverage ratio test with a first lien net leverage ratio maintenance test which\\nprovides for a maximum first lien net leverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter,\\nstepping down to 1.35 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2020 and thereafter.

There are inherent uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions; accordingly, it\\nis possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the\\nnear term. The estimates which require the most significant judgment are listed below.\\n\\ufeff\\nThese critical accounting estimates have been reviewed with our independent registered public\\naccounting firm and with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For a discussion of these and other\\naccounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\n\\n48\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of our\\nability to collect accounts receivable. Our estimates are based on assumptions and other considerations,\\nincluding payment history, customer financial performance, carrier billing disputes and aging analysis. Our\\nestimation process includes general and specific reserves and varies by customer category. In\\n2017 and 2016, we had no \"critical estimates\" related to bankruptcies of communications companies or any other\\nsignificant customers. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\\n\\ufeff\\nIndefinite-lived Intangibles\\nOur indefinite-lived intangibles consist of goodwill and trade name, which\\nwere generated as a result of business combinations. We test for impairment of these assets annually as of\\nDecember 31 or more frequently, whenever events occur, or\\nfacts and circumstances change that make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has\\nbeen reduced below its carrying amount. Events that might indicate impairment include, but are not limited to,\\nstrategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic\\nenvironment on our customer base, material negative changes in relationships with significant customers, and/or\\na significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe early adopted ASU 2017-04 \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test\\nfor Goodwill Impairment\" (\"ASU 2017-04\") during the second quarter of 2017. In accordance with ASU 2017-04, our\\nannual goodwill impairment test (and interim test if determined to be necessary) will consist of comparing the\\nfair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair\\nvalue, an impairment will be recognized.\\n\\ufeff\\nFor the purpose of our goodwill impairment test, we first assess qualitative\\nfactors to determine if it is more likely than not that fair value of the reporting unit is less than the\\ncarrying amount. If it is less, an additional quantitative evaluation must be performed. Our quantitative\\nassessment consists of using a market multiples approach to determine fair value. Marketplace company\\ncomparisons and analyst reports within the wireline telecommunications industry have historically supported a range of fair values of multiples\\nbetween 4.4x and 6.5x annualized EBITDA (defined as operating income, net of acquisition and integration costs, pension/OPEB\\nexpense, pension settlement costs, stock-based compensation expense, goodwill impairment, storm-related costs,\\nand restructuring costs and other charges, as well as depreciation and amortization).\\n\\ufeff\\nDuring 2017, our common stock declined and traded at historically low prices.\\nAs a result, we tested goodwill for impairment in each of the four quarters in 2017. Our second and fourth quarter quantitative assessments indicated that the carrying value of the\\nenterprise exceeded its fair value and, therefore, an impairment existed. We recorded goodwill impairments\\ntotaling $2,748 million for 2017. The driver for the impairment in the second quarter was a reduction in our\\nprofitability and utilized EBITDA estimate, which when applied to our market multiple resulted in a lower\\nenterprise valuation. During the fourth quarter, the impairment was largely driven by a lower enterprise\\nvaluation resulting from a reduction in utilized market multiple from 5.8x to 5.5x reflecting\\nour lower stock price and a lower outlook for wireline communications companies. The revaluation of our net deferred tax\\nliabilities which resulted from the enactment of Tax Cut and Job Act, caused further goodwill impairment (see\\nNote 12). The first and third\\nquarter quantitative assessments, did not result in goodwill impairment charges. In estimating the enterprise\\nfair value we used 5.8x as the multiple for the first three quarters of 2017 and 5.5x\\nfor the fourth quarter test.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe market multiples approach that we use incorporates significant estimates and assumptions\\nrelated to the forecasted results for the remainder of the year, including revenues, expenses, and the\\nachievement of other cost synergies. Our assessment includes many qualitative factors that require significant\\njudgment. Alternative interpretations of these factors could have resulted in different conclusions regarding\\nthe need for, or size of, an impairment. Continued declines in our profitability or cash flows or in sustained\\nlow trading prices of our common stock may result in further impairment.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe enterprise fair value is sensitive to the amount of EBITDA generated by\\nFrontier and the EBITDA multiple used in the calculation. Significant changes in the assumptions or estimates\\nused in our impairment analyses, such as a reduction in profitability and/or cash flows, could result in a\\nnon-cash goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge and materially affect our operating\\nresults. The market multiples approach is sensitive to changes in the estimated annual EBITDA, with each $100\\nmillion change equating to approximately $550 million of\\nestimated enterprise value. Similarly, a ten-basis point change in the multiple used would affect the estimated enterprise value by\\napproximately $355 million. Sustained low trading prices for\\nour common stock could also affect the reconciliation of our market capitalization and indicate further\\nimpairment.\\n\\n\\n49\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nWe also considered whether the carrying values of finite-lived intangible\\nassets and property plant and equipment may not be recoverable or whether the carrying value of certain\\nfinite-lived intangible assets were impaired, noting no impairment was present as of\\nDecember 31, 2017.\\n\\ufeff\\nDepreciation and Amortization\\nThe calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based upon the\\nestimated useful lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and identifiable finite-lived intangible\\nassets. Depreciation expense is principally based on the composite group method for substantially all of our\\nproperty, plant and equipment assets. The estimates for remaining lives of the various asset categories are\\ndetermined annually, based on an independent study. Among other considerations, these studies include models\\nthat consider actual usage, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution for each category of\\nasset. The latest study was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017\\nand did not result in any significant changes in remaining lives for any of our asset\\ncategories. A one year decrease in the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment would result\\nin an increase of approximately $180 million to depreciation expense.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur finite-lived intangibles consist principally of customer base;\\n$2,760 million from the 2010 Acquisition, $570 million from the Connecticut Acquisition and $2,190 million from the\\nCTF Acquisition. These customer bases are being amortized on an\\naccelerated method because this method most closely resembles the projected underlying revenue streams. In\\nassigning lives, which range from between eight and 12 years, a separate evaluation and determination is made\\nfor consumer and commercial\\ncustomers.\\n\\ufeff\\nSee Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\\ndiscussion.\\n\\ufeff\\nAsset Impairments\\nWe review long-lived assets to be held and used, including customer lists and\\nlong-lived assets to be disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that\\nthe carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. When triggering events are\\nidentified, recoverability of assets to be held and used is\\nmeasured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be\\ngenerated by the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of\\nthe assets to their estimated fair market value. If any assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is\\nmeasured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value. Also, we\\nperiodically reassess the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets to determine whether any changes are required.\\n\\ufeff\\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\\nWe sponsor a defined benefit pension plan covering a significant number of\\nour current and former employees as well as other postretirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental,\\nlife insurance and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents.\\nAs of December 31, 2017, the unfunded benefit obligation for\\nthese plans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was $1,705 million. During\\n2017, we contributed $75\\nmillion to these plans net of the differential (see note 17),\\nand recorded $208 million of expense before\\ncapitalization, including $83 million of pension settlement\\ncosts and $5 million of special termination benefits. Pension\\nand other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions, the\\nmost significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of\\nreturn on plan assets.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our\\nactuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on\\nlong-term, high quality corporate bonds with durations approximate to that of our benefit obligation. As of\\nDecember 31, 2017, and\\n2016, we utilized an estimation technique that is based upon\\na settlement model (Bond:Link) that permits us to closely match cash flows to the expected payments to\\nparticipants. This rate can change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond\\nyields.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe are utilizing a discount rate of 3.70% as of December 31, 2017 for our qualified pension plan, compared to rates of 4.10% and 4.50% in\\n2016 and 2015, respectively. The discount rate for postretirement plans as of December 31, 2017 was a range of 3.70% to 3.80% compared to a range of 4.10% to 4.30% in 2016\\nand 4.50% to\\n4.70% in 2015.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n50\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nIn the following table, we show the estimated sensitivity of our pension and\\nother postretirement benefit plan liabilities to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December\\n31, 2017:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n($ in millions)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncrease in Discount Rate of 25 bps\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDecrease in Discount Rate of 25 bps\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPension plans\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProjected benefit obligation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n(83)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n87\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther postretirement plans\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccumulated postretirement benefit obligation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n(36)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n38\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nIn developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we\\nconsidered published surveys of expected market returns, 10 and 20 year actual returns of various major\\nindices, and our own historical 5 year, 10 year and 20 year investment returns. The expected long-term rate of\\nreturn on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 40% in long-duration fixed income\\nsecurities, and 60% in equity securities and other investments. We review our asset allocation at least\\nannually and make changes when considered appropriate. Our asset return assumption is made at the beginning of\\nour fiscal year. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, our\\nexpected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 7.50%, 7.50% and 7.75%, respectively. Our actual\\nreturn on plan assets in 2017 was 16.50%. For 2018, we will assume a rate of return of\\n7.50%. Our pension plan assets are valued at fair value as of the measurement\\ndate.\\n\\ufeff\\nFor additional information regarding our pension and other postretirement\\nbenefits see Note 17 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements.\\n\\ufeff\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe file a consolidated federal income tax return. We utilize the asset and liability method of\\naccounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recorded for the\\ntax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and\\nliabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse.\\nActual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in governing law or review by taxing\\nauthorities.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe use a \"more likely than not\" threshold to the recognition and\\nderecognition of uncertain tax positions either taken or expected to be taken in Frontier\\'s income tax returns.\\nThe total amount of our gross tax liability for tax positions that may not be sustained under a \"more likely\\nthan not\" threshold amounts to $12 million as of December 31, 2017 including interest\\nof $1 million. For additional information regarding our\\naccounting for income taxes see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\ufeff\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe allocate the total cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets\\nbased on their respective estimated fair values. As part of this allocation process, we identify and attribute\\nvalues and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired. These determinations involve significant\\nestimates and assumptions about several highly subjective variables, including future cash flows, discount\\nrates, and asset lives. There are also different valuation models for each component, the selection of which\\nrequires considerable judgment. Our estimates and assumptions may be based, in part, on the availability of\\nlisted market prices or other transparent market data. These determinations will affect the amount of\\namortization expense recognized in future periods. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe\\nare reasonable, but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain. Depending on the size of the\\npurchase price of a particular acquisition and the mix of intangible assets acquired, the purchase price\\nallocation could be materially impacted by applying a different set of assumptions and estimates. Frontier\\nallocated $9,871 million and $2,018 million in total consideration to the \"fair market value\" of the assets\\nand liabilities acquired in the CTF Acquisition and the\\nConnecticut Acquisition, respectively. The estimates of the fair values assigned to property, plant and\\nequipment, customer list and goodwill, are more fully described in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements.\\n\\ufeff\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of this report\\nfor additional information related to recent accounting pronouncements.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n51\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n\\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\\n\\ufeff\\nWe are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing\\ninvesting and funding activities, including those associated with our pension plan assets. Market risk refers\\nto the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates\\nand equity prices. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other\\nfinancial instruments for trading purposes. As a result, we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our\\nexposure to market risks, and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the\\nnormal course of business. Our primary market risk exposures from interest rate risk and equity price risk are\\nas follows:\\n\\ufeff\\nInterest Rate Exposure\\n\\ufeff\\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily\\nto the interest-bearing portion of our pension investment portfolio and the related actuarial liability for\\npension obligations, as well as our floating rate indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, 80% of our long-term debt had fixed interest rates. We had no interest rate swap\\nagreements related to our fixed rate or variable rate debt in\\neffect at December 31, 2017 and 2016. We believe that our currently outstanding obligation exposure to\\ninterest rate changes is minimal.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of\\ninterest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve\\nthese objectives, only 20%\\nof our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2017\\nhave floating interest rates. Our undrawn $850 million revolving credit facility has interest rates that float with the LIBO Rate, as defined.\\nConsequently, we have limited material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on\\nour debt. An adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable rate\\nobligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Based upon our\\noverall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2017, a\\nnear-term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of\\noperations or cash flows.\\n\\ufeff\\nAt December 31, 2017, the\\nfair value of our long-term debt was estimated to be approximately\\n$14 billion, based on prevailing interest rates, our overall\\nweighted average borrowing rate of 8.44% and\\nour overall weighted average maturity of approximately six\\nyears. As of December 31, 2017, there has\\nbeen no significant change in the weighted average maturity applicable to our obligations since December 31,\\n2016.\\n\\ufeff\\nEquity Price Exposure\\n\\ufeff\\nOur exposure to market risks for changes in equity security prices as of December 31, 2017 is\\nlimited to our pension plan assets. We have no other security investments of any significant amount.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur Pension Plan assets decreased from $2,766 million at December 31, 2016 to\\n$2,674 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of\\n$92 million, or 3%. This decrease was a result of benefit payments of\\n$544 million, primarily lump sum\\nsettlements of $486 million, partially offset by positive investment returns of\\n$378 million, net of investment management and administrative fees, and contributions in\\nexcess of the Differential (as defined below) of $74 million, during 2017.\\n\\ufeff\\nAs part of the CTF Acquisition, Verizon was required to make a cash payment\\nto Frontier for the difference in assets initially transferred by Verizon into the Pension Plan and the related\\nobligation (the Differential). During 2017, we received the $131 million Differential payment from Verizon, and\\nhave remitted an equivalent amount to the Pension Plan as of December 31, 2017. As the Differential was\\nreflected as a receivable of the Pension Plan at December 31, 2016, the cash funding had no impact to plan\\nassets.\\n\\ufeff\\nItem 8.

Those standards require\\nthat we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial\\nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing\\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due\\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining,\\non a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our\\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as\\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our\\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\n\\nAccompanying Supplemental Information\\n\\ufeff\\nThe supplemental information contained in the Schedule of Pledged Subsidiary Financial Data has\\nbeen subjected to audit procedures performed in conjunction with the audit of the Company\\'s consolidated\\nfinancial statements.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material\\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria\\nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting\\nOversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\"), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31,\\n2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, equity, and cash flows\\nfor each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively,\\nthe \"consolidated financial statements\"), and our report dated February 28, 2018 expressed an unqualified\\nopinion on those consolidated financial statements.\\nBasis for Opinion\\n\\ufeff\\nThe Company\\'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over\\nfinancial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,\\nincluded in the accompanying Management\\'s Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our\\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on our\\naudit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require\\nthat we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over\\nfinancial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial\\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk\\nthat a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal\\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered\\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\n\\ufeff\\nA company\\'s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide\\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\'s\\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the\\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\\nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\'s assets that\\ncould have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent\\nor detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to\\nthe risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n/s/ KPMG LLP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStamford,

Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Description of Business and Summary of\\nSignificant Accounting Policies:\\n(a) Description of Business:\\nFrontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) is the fourth largest\\nIncumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) in the United States, with approximately 4.9 million customers, 3.9 million broadband subscribers and 22,700\\nemployees, operating in 29 states. Frontier\\nwas incorporated in 1935, originally under the name of Citizens Utilities Company and was known as Citizens\\nCommunications Company until July 31, 2008. Frontier and its subsidiaries are referred to as \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\"\\n\"Frontier,\" or the \"Company\" in this report.\\n\\ufeff\\nEffective April 1, 2016, Frontier\\'s scope of operations and balance sheet changed materially\\nas a result of the completion of the CTF Acquisition, as described in Note 3 - Acquisitions. Historical\\nfinancial data presented for Frontier is not indicative of the future financial position or operating results\\nfor Frontier, and includes the results of the CTF Operations, as defined in Note 3 - Acquisitions, from the\\ndate of acquisition on April 1, 2016.\\n\\ufeff\\n(b) Basis of Presentation and Use of\\nEstimates:\\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting\\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Certain reclassifications of amounts\\npreviously reported have been made to conform to the current presentation. All significant intercompany\\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\\n\\ufeff\\nFor our financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2017, we evaluated\\nsubsequent events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through the date that we filed this\\nForm 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\\n\\ufeff\\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to\\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of\\nthe financial statements, (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and (iii) the reported\\namounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\\nEstimates and judgments are used when accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts, asset impairments,\\nindefinite-lived intangibles, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, business combinations, and pension\\nand other postretirement benefits, among others.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn July 10, 2017, we effected a one for fifteen reverse stock split of our common stock. The reverse stock split reduced\\nthe number of common shares issued (which includes outstanding shares and treasury shares) from\\napproximately 1,193,000,000 shares to 80,000,000 shares, and reduced shares outstanding from 1,178,000,000 shares to 79,000,000 shares. In addition, and at the same time, the total number of shares of common stock that Frontier is\\nauthorized to issue changed from 1,750,000,000 shares\\nto 175,000,000 shares. There was no change in the par value\\nof the common stock, and no fractional shares were issued.\\nAll share and per share amounts in the financial statements and footnotes have been retroactively adjusted for\\nall periods presented to give effect to the reverse stock split. As a result of our reverse stock split the\\nconversion rates of our Series A Preferred Stock were proportionately adjusted.\\n\\ufeff\\n(c) Cash Equivalents:\\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three\\nmonths or less to be cash equivalents. Restricted cash of $14 million is included within \"Income taxes and other current assets\" on our\\nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. This amount represents funds held as collateral by certain\\ninsurance carriers, of which $7 million was released in\\nJanuary 2018, and the remainder expected to be released in the first quarter of 2018.\\n\\ufeff\\n(d) Revenue Recognition:\\nRevenue\\nis recognized when services are provided or when products are delivered to customers. Revenue that is billed in\\nadvance includes monthly recurring network access services (including data services), special access services\\nand monthly recurring voice, video and related charges. The unearned portion of these fees is initially\\ndeferred as a component of \"Advanced billings\" on our consolidated balance sheet and recognized as revenue over\\nthe period that the services are provided. Revenue that is billed in arrears includes non-recurring network\\naccess services (including data services), switched access services and non-recurring voice\\n\\n\\nF-9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\nand video services. The earned but unbilled portion of these fees is recognized as revenue in\\nour consolidated statements of operations and accrued in \"Accounts Receivable\" on our consolidated balance\\nsheet in the period that the services are provided. Excise taxes are recognized as a liability when billed.\\nInstallation fees and their related direct and incremental costs are initially deferred and recognized as\\nrevenue and expense over the average term of a customer relationship. We recognize as current period expense\\nthe portion of installation costs that exceeds installation fee revenue.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier collects\\nvarious taxes from its customers and subsequently remits these taxes to governmental authorities. Substantially\\nall of these taxes are recorded through the consolidated balance sheet and presented on a net basis in our\\nconsolidated statements of operations. We also collect Universal Service Fund (USF) surcharges from customers\\n(primarily federal USF) that we have recorded on a gross basis in our consolidated statements of operations and\\nincluded within \"Revenue\" and \"Network related expenses\" of $216 million, $217 million and $151 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,\\nrespectively.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn 2015 we accepted the FCC\\'s Connect America Fund (CAF) Phase II offer of support, which is a\\nsuccessor to and augments the USF frozen high cost support that we had been receiving pursuant to a 2011 FCC\\norder. Upon completion of the CTF Acquisition, Frontier assumed the CAF Phase II support and related\\nobligations that Verizon had previously accepted with regard to California and Texas. CAF Phase II funding is a\\nprogram intended to subsidize the high cost of establishing and delivering communications services to certain\\nunserved or underserved areas. We are recognizing these subsidies into revenue on a straight line basis, which\\nis consistent with how the costs related to these subsidies are being and are expected to be incurred. CAF\\nPhase II is a multi-year program which requires us to deploy broadband to a specified number of households in\\neach of the states where funding was accepted. Failure to meet our deployment obligations at the end of the\\nprogram in 2020 will result in a return of a portion of the funding received. We regularly evaluate our ability\\nto meet our broadband deployment obligations and adjust revenue accordingly.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe categorize our products, services and other revenues among the following five\\ncategories:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nData and Internet services include broadband\\nservices for consumer and commercial customers. We provide data transmission services to high volume commercial\\ncustomers and other carriers with dedicated high capacity circuits (\"nonswitched access\") including services to\\nwireless providers (\"wireless backhaul\");\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVoice services include traditional local and\\nlong-distance wireline services, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, as well as a number of unified\\nmessaging services offered to our consumer and commercial customers. Voice services also include the\\nlong-distance voice origination and termination services that we provide to our commercial customers and other\\ncarriers;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVideo services include revenues generated from\\nservices provided directly to consumer customers through the FiOS®\\nand Vantage video brands, and through DISH® satellite TV services;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther customer revenue includes sales of customer\\npremise equipment to our commercial customers and directory services, less our provision for bad debts;\\nand\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSwitched Access and Subsidy revenues include\\nrevenues derived from allowing other carriers to use our network to originate and/or terminate their local and\\nlong-distance voice traffic (\"switched access\"). These services are primarily billed on a minutes-of-use basis\\napplying tariffed rates filed with the FCC or state agencies. We also receive cost subsidies from state and\\nfederal authorities, including the Connect America Fund Phase II.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\nF-10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following table provides a summary of revenues from external customers by the categories\\nof Frontier\\'s products and services:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the year ended December 31,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n($ in millions)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nData and Internet services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n3,862\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n3,693\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,337\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVoice services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2,864\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2,886\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2,022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVideo services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,304\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,244\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n285\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n322\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n276\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n255\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomer revenue\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8,352\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8,099\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4,899\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSwitched access and subsidy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n776\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n797\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n677\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal revenue\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n9,128\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,896\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,576\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n(e) Property, Plant and\\nEquipment:\\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at original cost, including capitalized interest, or\\nfair market value as of the date of acquisition for acquired properties. Maintenance and repairs are charged to\\noperating expenses as incurred. The gross book value of routine property, plant and equipment retirements is\\ncharged against accumulated depreciation.\\n\\ufeff\\n(f) Goodwill and Other\\nIntangibles:\\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable tangible\\nand intangible net assets acquired. We undertake studies to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities\\nacquired and allocate purchase prices to assets and liabilities, including property, plant and equipment,\\ngoodwill and other identifiable intangibles. We examine the carrying value of our goodwill and trade name\\nannually as of December 31, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant, to determine whether there are any\\nimpairment losses. We test for goodwill impairment at the \"operating segment\" level, as that term is defined in\\nGAAP.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe determined that we have one\\noperating segment based on a number of factors that our management uses to evaluate and run\\nour business operations, including similarities of customers, products and technology. We tested goodwill for\\nimpairment as of December 31, 2017 as a result of the continued decline in share price of our common stock\\nsince September 30, 2017, the date of our last goodwill impairment test. Refer to Note 6 for a discussion of\\nour goodwill impairment testing and results as of December 31, 2017. As stated in Note 2, we early adopted ASU\\nNo. 2017-04, \"Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\" during 2017 in conjunction with our goodwill\\nimpairment assessment.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier amortizes finite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on the\\naccelerated method of sum of the years digits. We review such intangible assets at least annually as of\\nDecember 31 to assess whether any potential impairment exists and whether factors exist that would necessitate\\na change in useful life and a different amortization period.\\n\\ufeff\\n(g) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and\\nLong-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of:\\nWe review long-lived assets to be held and used, including customer lists, and long-lived\\nassets to be disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\\namount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by\\ncomparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated\\nby the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets\\nto their estimated fair market value. If any assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured\\nby the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value. Also, we\\nperiodically reassess the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets to determine whether any changes\\nare required.\\n\\n\\n\\nF-11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(h) Income Taxes and Deferred Income\\nTaxes:\\nWe file a consolidated federal income tax return. We utilize the asset and liability method of\\naccounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recorded for the\\ntax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and\\nliabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to\\nreverse.\\n\\ufeff\\n(i) Stock Plans:\\nWe have various stock-based compensation plans. Awards under these plans are granted to\\neligible employees and directors. Awards may be made in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified\\nstock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units or other stock-based awards,\\nincluding awards with performance, market and time-vesting conditions. Our general policy is to issue shares\\nfrom treasury upon the grant of restricted shares, earning of performance shares and the exercise of\\noptions.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe compensation cost recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest. GAAP requires\\nforfeitures to be estimated and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from\\nthose estimates.\\n\\ufeff\\n(j) Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Frontier\\nCommon Shareholders:\\nBasic net loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares\\noutstanding during the period being reported on, excluding unvested restricted stock awards. The impact of\\ndividends paid on unvested restricted stock awards have been deducted in the determination of basic and diluted\\nnet income (loss) per share attributable to Frontier common shareholders. Except when the effect would be\\nantidilutive, diluted net income per common share reflects the dilutive effect of certain common stock\\nequivalents, as described further in Note 13 - Net Loss Per Common Share.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n(2) Recent Accounting\\nPronouncements:\\n\\ufeff\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\n\\ufeff\\nRevenue Recognition\\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards\\nUpdate (ASU) No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\" This standard, along with its related\\namendments, requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to\\ncustomers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which they expect to be entitled in exchange for\\nthose goods or services. This new standard will be adopted by Frontier for annual and interim reporting periods\\nbeginning with the first quarter of 2018.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe FASB allows two adoption methods under ASC 606. Companies are permitted to either apply\\nthe requirements retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or apply the requirements in the year of\\nadoption, through a cumulative adjustment. We currently plan to adopt the standard in the first quarter of\\n2018, using the \"modified retrospective method.\" Under that method, we will apply the rules to all contracts\\nexisting as of January 1, 2018, recognizing, in beginning retained earnings, a cumulative-effect adjustment to\\ninclude the establishment of contract asset and contract liability accounts with a corresponding adjustment to\\nretained earnings. We will also provide additional disclosures comparing revenue recognized under ASC 606 to\\nrevenue as reported prior to the adoption of the standard.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe key changes in the standard that impact our\\nrevenue recognition relate to the allocation of contract revenues among various services and equipment, and the\\ntiming of when those revenues are recognized. Additionally, the new standard will impact the timing of\\nrecognizing costs to obtain contracts. This includes a change in our existing policy related to the way we\\naccount for the allocation of discounts, customer\\nincentives, upfront non-recurring charges, customer disputes and commission payments.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe are implementing changes to our systems, processes,\\npolicies and internal controls to meet the standard\\'s reporting and disclosure requirements.\\nWe believe the changes will impact service revenue categorization as\\n\\n\\nF-12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\nwell as Selling, general and administrative expenses, however, we do not anticipate its impact will be material to operating income.\\n\\ufeff\\nLeases\\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016 - 02, \"Leases (Topic\\n842).\" This standard, along with its related\\namendments, establishes the principles to report transparent and economically\\nneutral information about the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. Upon implementation,\\nlessees will need to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a\\nright-of-use asset and a lease liability. It will be critical to identify leases embedded in a contract to\\navoid misstating the lessee\\'s balance sheet. The income statement impacts of the\\nleases will depend on the nature of the leasing arrangement and will be similar to existing accounting for\\noperating and capital leases. Classification will be based on criteria that are\\nlargely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. Lessor\\naccounting is similar to the current model, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and\\nthe new revenue recognition standard. Existing sale-leaseback guidance, including guidance for real estate, is\\nreplaced with a new model applicable to both lessees and lessors. The new guidance\\nis effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal\\nyears using modified retrospective application. Early application is\\npermitted. Frontier is in the initial stages of\\nevaluating the potential impact this new standard may have on the consolidated financial statements.\\n\\ufeff\\nCompensation - Retirement Benefits\\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, \"Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic\\nPension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost\". This standard was established to improve the\\npresentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost by requiring that an\\nemployer disaggregate the service cost component of periodic benefit cost from the other components of net\\nbenefit cost. The amendments in the update also provide explicit guidance on how to present the service cost\\ncomponent and other components of net benefit cost in the income statement and allow only the service cost\\ncomponents of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization. The new guidance is effective for annual\\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods and requires\\nthe presentation of the income statement to be applied retrospectively. As a result of the standard, pension\\nsettlement costs and certain benefit costs which are currently included in operating expense, would be reported\\nas other non-operating expense and will no longer be capitalized. This will have a material impact on\\npreviously reported operating income and may have a material impact to operating income in future periods,\\nhowever, the impact to pre-tax income is not expected to be material.\\n\\ufeff\\nReclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\\nIn February 2018, FASB issued ASU 2018-02, which allows for the reclassification of certain income tax effects\\nrelated to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") between \"Accumulated other comprehensive income\" and\\n\"Retained earnings.\" This ASU relates to the requirement that adjustments to deferred tax liabilities and\\nassets related to a change in tax laws or rates to be included in \"Income from continuing operations\", even in\\nsituations where the related items were originally recognized in \"Other comprehensive income\" (rather than in\\n\"Income from continuing operations\"). The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal\\nyears beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption\\npermitted. Adoption of this ASU is to be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each\\nperiod in which the effect of the change in the tax laws or rates were recognized.

This standard provides guidance on\\nthe types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards to which an entity would be\\nrequired to apply modification accounting under ASC 718. Specifically, an entity would not apply modification\\naccounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the awards are the same immediately\\nbefore and after the modification. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December\\n15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods and early adoption is permitted including in\\nany interim period. Frontier has adopted this standard during the second quarter 2017, with no impact to our\\nshare-based payment awards.\\n\\ufeff\\nIntangibles - Goodwill\\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, \"Simplifying the Test for\\nGoodwill Impairment.\" This standard was established to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for\\nimpairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a\\ngoodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit\\'s goodwill with the carrying\\namount of that goodwill. Under the amendments in this Update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim,\\ngoodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity\\nshould recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\\'s\\nfair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that\\nreporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on\\nthe carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The FASB\\nalso eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a\\nqualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment\\ntest. Therefore, the same impairment assessment applies to all reporting units. An entity is required to\\ndisclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net\\nassets. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine\\nif the quantitative impairment test is necessary. Frontier early adopted this standard during\\nin 2017 in conjunction with our goodwill impairment assessment. See\\nNote 1 and Note 6 for further discussion.\\n\\ufeff\\nCompensation - Stock Compensation\\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee\\nShare-Based Payment Accounting,\" to amend ASC Topic 718, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation.\" The ASU is part\\nof the FASB\\'s ongoing simplification initiative, which is designed to reduce cost and complexity while\\nmaintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to the users of financial statements. The\\nsimplifications address a variety of areas for public entities, including the following: 1) accounting for\\nincome taxes, 2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, 3) forfeitures, 4)\\nminimum statutory tax withholding requirements, 5) classifications of employee taxes paid on the statement of\\ncash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax withholding purposes, and 6) classification of awards with\\nrepurchase features. This guidance was effective for Frontier as of the third quarter of 2017. During\\nthe year ended December\\n31, 2017 Frontier recognized $1 million of income tax expense and recorded a\\ncumulative effect adjustment to beginning accumulated deficit of $1\\nmillion to recognize all unrecognized deferred tax benefits recorded as of January 1, 2017.\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Frontier reclassified $10 million and $14 million,\\nrespectively, of taxes paid on\\nbehalf of employees related to shares withheld from \"Cash flows provided from (used by) operations\" to \"Cash\\nflows used by financing activities\" in accordance with the new standard.\\n\\ufeff\\n(3) Acquisitions:\\n\\ufeff\\nThe CTF Acquisition\\nOn April 1, 2016, Frontier acquired the wireline operations of Verizon\\nCommunications, Inc. in California, Texas and Florida for a purchase price of $10,540 million in cash and assumed debt (the CTF Acquisition), pursuant to the\\nFebruary 5, 2015 Securities Purchase Agreement, as amended.

These measurement period adjustments resulted in $20\\nmillion of amortization expense during the first quarter of 2017 that would have been\\nrecorded in 2016 if the adjustments had been recognized as of the acquisition date. Other adjustments to the\\nallocation of the purchase price for the CTF Acquisition during the first quarter of 2017 resulted in a\\n$140 million decrease in Property, plant & equipment,\\na $61 million increase in Current liabilities, and\\na $98 million increase in Goodwill.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe total consideration exceeded the net estimated fair value of the assets\\nacquired and liabilities assumed by $2,606 million, which we\\nrecognized as goodwill.

Due to the continued decline in our stock\\nprice we had triggering events in each of the four quarters in 2017.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe use a market multiples approach to determine fair value. Marketplace\\ncompany comparisons and analyst reports within the wireline telecommunications industry have historically supported a range of fair values of multiples\\nbetween 4.4x and 6.5x annualized EBITDA (defined as operating income, net\\nof acquisition and integration costs, pension/OPEB expense, pension settlement costs, stock-based compensation\\nexpense, goodwill impairment, storm-related costs, and restructuring costs and other charges, as well as\\ndepreciation and amortization). We estimated the enterprise fair value using a multiple of 5.8x EBITDA for the first three quarters in 2017 and a multiple of\\n5.5x EBITDA for the fourth quarter evaluation.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur second and fourth quarter quantitative assessments indicated that the carrying value of\\nthe enterprise exceeded its fair value and, therefore, an impairment existed. We elected to early adopt the\\nsimplified goodwill testing method under ASU 2017-04, recording goodwill impairments totaling $2,748 million\\nfor 2017. The driver for the impairment in the second quarter was a reduction in our profitability and utilized\\nEBITDA estimate, which when applied to our market multiple resulted in a lower enterprise valuation. During the\\nfourth quarter, the impairment was largely driven by a lower enterprise valuation resulting from a reduction in\\nutilized market multiple from 5.8x to 5.5x reflecting the lower outlook for our industry as a whole. The\\nrevaluation of our net\\n\\n\\nF-18\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\ndeferred tax liabilities which resulted from the enactment of Tax Cut and Job Act, caused\\nfurther goodwill impairment (see Note 12).\\n\\ufeff\\nOur first and third quarter quantitative assessments indicated that the fair value of the\\nenterprise exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, no indication of impairment existed in either\\nperiod.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe market multiples approach that we use incorporates significant estimates and assumptions\\nrelated to the forecasted results for the remainder of the year including revenues, expenses, and the\\nachievement of other cost synergies. Our assessment includes many qualitative factors that require significant\\njudgment. Alternative interpretations of these factors could have resulted in different conclusions regarding\\nthe need for, or size of, an impairment. Continued declines in our profitability or cash flows or in the\\nsustained, historically low trading prices of our common stock may result in further impairment.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe also considered whether the carrying values of finite-lived intangible assets and property\\nplant and equipment may not be recoverable or whether the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived intangible\\nassets were impaired, noting no additional impairment was present as of December 31, 2017.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe components of other intangibles at December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as\\nfollows:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n($ in millions)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGross Carrying Amount\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccumulated Amortization\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNet Carrying Amount\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGross Carrying Amount\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccumulated Amortization\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNet Carrying Amount\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Intangibles:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomer base\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,188\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n(3,294)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,894\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,088\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n(2,604)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,484\\n\\n\\n\\nTrade name\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n122\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n122\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n122\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n122\\n\\n\\n\\nRoyalty agreement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n72\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(25)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n47\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n72\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(16)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n56\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal other intangibles\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,382\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n(3,319)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,063\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,282\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n(2,620)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,662\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\nAmortization expense was as follows:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the Year Ended\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n($ in millions)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmortization expense\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n699\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n643\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n337\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nAmortization expense primarily represents the amortization of our customer base acquired as a result of the CTF Acquisition, the Connecticut Acquisition and the acquisition of certain\\nVerizon properties in 2010 with each based on a useful life of 8 to 12 years on an accelerated method.\\nThe approximate weighted average remaining life of our customer base is 6 years and for our royalty agreement is 3\\nyears.

Each was issued at a price equal\\nto 100% of its principal amount. Frontier used the net\\nproceeds from the offering (after deducting underwriting fees) to finance a portion of the cash consideration\\npaid in connection with the CTF Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. The net proceeds of the debt\\noffering of $6,485 million were included in \"Restricted cash\"\\nin the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.

A pretax loss of approximately $7\\nmillion was recognized and included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year\\nended December 31, 2016.\\n\\ufeff\\nDuring 2015, Frontier used cash available on hand for the scheduled\\nretirement of $97 million of 7.875% Senior Notes, and $105 million 6.625% Senior Notes at maturity.\\n\\ufeff\\nTerm Loans and Credit Facilities\\nOn February 27, 2017, Frontier entered into a first amended and restated\\ncredit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto,\\npursuant to which Frontier combined its revolving credit agreement, dated as of June 2, 2014, and its term loan\\ncredit agreement, dated as of August 12, 2015. Under the JPM Credit Agreement, as further amended on June 15,\\n2017 by Increase Joinder No.1 (as so amended, the JPM Credit Agreement), Frontier has a $1,625 million senior secured term loan A facility (the Term Loan A) maturing\\non March 31, 2021, an $850\\nmillion undrawn secured revolving credit facility maturing on February 27, 2022 (the Revolver), and $1,500\\nmillion senior secured term loan B facility (the Term Loan B) maturing on\\nJune 15, 2024. The maturities of the Term Loan A, the Revolver,\\nand the Term Loan B, in each case if still outstanding, will be accelerated in the following circumstances: (i)\\nif, 91 days before the maturity date of any series of\\nSenior Notes maturing in 2020, 2023 and 2024, more than $500 million in principal amount remains outstanding on such series; or (ii) if, 91 days before the maturity\\ndate of the first series of Senior Notes maturing in 2021 or 2022, more than $500 million in principal amount\\nremains outstanding, in the aggregate, on the two series of Senior Notes maturing in such year. The\\ndetermination of interest rates for each of the facilities under the JPM Credit Agreement is based on margins\\nover the Base Rate (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement) or over LIBOR, at the election of Frontier.\\nInterest rate margins on the Term Loan A and Revolver (ranging from 0.75%\\nto 1.75% for Base Rate borrowings\\nand 1.75% to 2.75%\\nfor LIBOR borrowings) are subject to adjustment based on Frontier\\'s Total Leverage Ratio (as\\ndefined in the JPM Credit Agreement). The interest rate on the Term Loan A as of December 31, 2017 was LIBOR\\nplus 2.75%. Interest rate margins on the Term Loan B\\n(2.75% for Base Rate borrowings and 3.75% for LIBOR borrowings) are not subject to adjustment. The security\\npackage under the JPM Credit Agreement includes pledges of the equity interests in certain Frontier\\nsubsidiaries and guaranties by certain Frontier subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017\\nno borrowing had been made under the revolving credit facility. Letters of credit, which may be issued under\\nthe revolver up to a maximum of $134 million, reduce\\navailable borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility.

The remaining outstanding principal balances to be repaid on the maturity\\ndate.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn March 29, 2017, Frontier amended the 2014 and 2016 CoBank Credit\\nAgreements. The amendments provide that interest rate margins under each of these facilities will range\\nfrom 0.875% to 3.875%\\nfor Base Rate borrowings and 1.875% to 4.875% for LIBOR borrowings, subject to\\nadjustment based on our Total Leverage Ratio, as defined in each credit agreement. The interest rate on each of\\nthe facilities as of December 31, 2017 was LIBOR plus 3.875%. In addition, the amendments provide for increases in the maximum Leverage Ratio and expansion of the\\nsecurity package identical to those contained in the JPM Credit Agreement.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn January 25, 2018 Frontier further amended its credit agreements with JP Morgan Chase and\\nCoBank (JPM Credit Amendment). The amendments expanded the security package to include interests of certain\\nsubsidiaries previously not pledged and replaced the net leverage ratio maintenance test with a first lien net\\nleverage ratio maintenance test.\\n\\ufeff\\nDuring 2015, we entered into secured financings totaling $3 million with four year\\nterms and no stated interest rate for certain equipment purchases.\\n\\ufeff\\nAs of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our debt and credit facility\\ncovenants.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur scheduled principal payments are as follows as of December 31,\\n2017:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrincipal\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n($ in millions)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPayments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2018\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n656\\n\\n\\n\\n2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n804\\n\\n\\n\\n2020\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,132\\n\\n\\n\\n2021\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,558\\n\\n\\n\\n2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,703\\n\\n\\n\\nThereafter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n10,010\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\nF-23\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Obligations\\nDuring 2016, Frontier\\ncontributed a real estate property with a fair value of $15 million for the purpose of funding a portion of its contribution obligations to its qualified defined\\nbenefit pension plan. The pension plan obtained independent appraisals of\\nthe property and, based on these appraisals, the pension plan recorded the contribution at\\nits fair value of $15 million. Frontier has entered into a\\nlease for the contributed property with initial terms of 15 years at a combined aggregate annual rent of approximately $2\\nmillion. The property is managed on behalf of the pension plan by an independent fiduciary,\\nand the terms of the lease were negotiated with the fiduciary on an arm\\'s-length basis.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe contribution and leaseback of the property was treated as a financing\\ntransaction and, accordingly, Frontier continues to depreciate the carrying value of\\nthe property in its financial statements and no gain or loss\\nwas recognized. An obligation of $15 million was recorded in\\nour consolidated balance sheet within \"Other liabilities\" and the liability is reduced annually by a portion of\\nthe lease payments made to the pension plan.\\n\\ufeff\\nDuring 2017 and 2016, Frontier modified certain operating leases for vehicles which resulted in the classification as capital\\nleases.

The amount and timing of dividends\\npayable on common and preferred stock are, subject to applicable law, within the sole discretion of our Board\\nof Directors.\\n\\ufeff\\nCommon Stock Offering\\nOn June 10, 2015, prior to the reverse stock split\\n(see Footnote 1) we completed a registered offering of 150,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.25 per share, at an offering price of $5\\nper share. On June\\n\\n\\nF-25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n24, 2015, Frontier issued an additional 15,000,000 shares of common stock in connection with the over-allotment option\\nthat was exercised in full by the underwriters. Aggregate net proceeds were approximately $799 million after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. We used the net\\nproceeds from this offering to fund a portion of the acquisition price of the CTF Acquisition and related fees\\nand expenses.\\n\\ufeff\\nMandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A) Offering\\nOn June 10, 2015, prior to the reverse stock\\nsplit, we completed a registered offering of 17,500,000 shares of our 11.125% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01\\nper share (the \"Series A Preferred Stock\"), at an offering price of $100 per share. On June 24, 2015, Frontier issued an additional\\n1,750,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in connection with the\\nover-allotment option that was exercised in full by the underwriters. Aggregate net proceeds of the offering\\nwere $1,866 million after deducting commissions and estimated\\nexpenses. We used the net proceeds from this offering to fund a portion of the acquisition price of the CTF\\nAcquisition and related fees and expenses.\\n\\ufeff\\nUnless converted earlier, each share of the Series A Preferred Stock will\\nautomatically convert on June 29, 2018 into common stock, (between 1.1348\\nand 1.3333 shares on a post-split basis) depending on the applicable market value of our common\\nstock, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. Subject to certain restrictions, at any time prior to June 29,\\n2018, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may elect to convert all or a portion of their shares into common\\nstock at the minimum conversion rate then in effect.\\n\\ufeff\\nDividends on shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are payable on a\\ncumulative basis when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors (or an authorized committee thereof) at an\\nannual rate of 11.125% on the liquidation preference\\nof $100.00 per share, on the last business day of March,\\nJune, September and December of each year, commencing on September 30, 2015 to, and including, the mandatory\\nconversion date. Series A Preferred Stock dividends of $214 million, $214 million, and $120 million were paid in 2017, 2016, and 2015 respectively.\\n\\ufeff\\nPursuant to the terms of the CTF Acquisition, $1,955 million of the $2,665 million in net proceeds from the equity offerings were deposited into escrow and were included in\\n\"Restricted cash\" in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. Upon closing of the CTF\\nAcquisition, the funds were released and used to fund a portion of the purchase price.\\n\\ufeff\\n(11) Stock Plans:\\nAt December 31, 2017, we had seven\\nstock-based compensation plans under which grants were made and awards remained outstanding.\\nNo further awards may be granted under six of the plans: the\\n1996 Equity Incentive Plan (the 1996 EIP), the Amended and Restated 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 EIP),\\nthe 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2009 EIP), the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2013 EIP), the Deferred Fee\\nPlan and the Directors\\' Equity Plan. At December 31, 2017, there were approximately 5,667,000 shares authorized for grant and approximately 4,361,000 shares available for grant under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2017 EIP and together with the 1996\\nEIP, the 2000 EIP, the 2009 EIP and the 2013 EIPS, the EIPs). Our general policy is to issue treasury shares\\nupon the grant of restricted shares and the exercise of options.\\n\\ufeff\\n1996, 2000, 2009, 2013, and 2017 Equity Incentive Plans\\nSince the expiration dates of the 1996 EIP, the 2000 EIP, the 2009 EIP, and\\nthe 2013 EIP on May 22, 2006, May 14, 2009, May 8, 2013, and May 10, 2017, respectively, no awards have been or\\nmay be granted under the 1996 EIP, the 2000 EIP, the 2009 EIP, and the 2013 EIP.\\nUnder the 2017 EIP, awards of our common stock may be granted to eligible employees in the form of incentive\\nstock options, non-qualified stock options, SARs, restricted stock, performance shares or other stock-based\\nawards. As discussed under the Non-Employee Directors\\' Compensation Plans below, prior to May 25, 2006\\nnon-employee directors received an award of stock options under the 2000 EIP upon commencement of\\nservice. No awards may be granted more than 10\\nyears after the effective date (May 10, 2017) of the 2017 EIP plan. The exercise price of\\nstock options and SARs under the EIPs generally are equal to or greater than the fair market value of the\\nunderlying common stock on the date of grant. Stock options are not ordinarily exercisable on the date of grant\\nbut vest over a period of time (generally four years).\\nUnder the terms of the EIPs, subsequent stock dividends and stock splits have the effect of increasing the\\noption shares outstanding, which correspondingly decrease the average exercise price of outstanding\\noptions.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\nF-26\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\nPerformance Shares\\nOn February 15, 2012, Frontier\\'s Compensation Committee, in consultation\\nwith the other non-management directors of Frontier\\'s Board of Directors and the Committee\\'s independent\\nexecutive compensation consultant, adopted the Frontier Long-Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP). LTIP awards are\\ngranted in the form of performance shares. The LTIP is currently offered under Frontier\\'s 2009\\nEIP, 2013 EIP and 2017\\nEIP, and participants consist of senior vice presidents and above. The LTIP awards\\nhave performance, market and time-vesting conditions.\\n\\ufeff\\nBeginning in 2012, during the first 90\\ndays of a three-year performance period (a\\nMeasurement Period), a target number of performance shares are awarded to each LTIP participant with respect to\\nthe Measurement Period. The performance metrics under the LTIP are (1) annual targets for operating cash flow\\nbased on a goal set during the first 90 days of each year in the three-year Measurement Period and (2) an\\noverall performance \"modifier\" set during the first 90 days of the Measurement Period, based on Frontier\\'s\\ntotal return to stockholders (i.e., Total Shareholder Return or TSR) relative to the Integrated\\nTelecommunications Services Group (GICS Code 50101020) for the three-year Measurement Period. Operating cash\\nflow performance is determined at the end of each year and the annual results will be averaged at the end of\\nthe three-year Measurement Period to determine the preliminary number of shares earned under the LTIP award.\\nThe TSR performance measure is then applied to decrease or increase payouts based on Frontier\\'s three year\\nrelative TSR performance. LTIP awards, to the extent earned, will be paid out in the form of common stock\\nshortly following the end of the three-year Measurement Period.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn February 25, 2015, the Compensation Committee\\ngranted approximately 665,000 performance shares under the\\nLTIP and set the operating cash flow performance goal for 2015, which applies to the first year in the\\n2015-2017 measurement period, the second year of the 2014-2016 measurement period and the third year of the\\n2013-2015 measurement period. On February 11, 2016, the Compensation Committee\\ngranted approximately 1,669,000 performance shares under\\nthe LTIP and set the operating cash flow performance goal for 2016, which applies to the first year in the\\n2016-2018 measurement period, the second year of the 2015-2017 measurement period and the third year of the\\n2014-2016 measurement period. On February 16, 2017, the Compensation Committee of our\\nBoard of Directors granted approximately 157,400 performance shares under the Frontier Long Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP) and set the operating cash\\nflow performance goal for 2017, which applies to the first year in the 2017-2019 measurement period, the second\\nyear of the 2016-2018 measurement period and the third year of the 2015-2017 measurement period.\\nThe number of shares of common stock earned at the end of each three-year Measurement Period\\nmay be more or less than the number of target performance shares granted as a result of operating cash flow and\\nTSR performance. An executive must maintain a satisfactory performance rating during the Measurement Period and\\nmust be employed by Frontier at the end of the three-year Measurement Period in order for the award to vest.\\nThe Compensation Committee will determine the number of shares earned for each three year Measurement Period in\\nFebruary of the year following the end of the Measurement Period.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\nF-27\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following summary presents information regarding LTIP target performance\\nshares as of December 31, 2017 and changes during the three\\nyears then ended with regard to LTIP shares awarded under the 2009 EIP,\\n2013 EIP, and 2017 EIP:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNumber of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShares\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(in thousands)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBalance at December 31, 2014\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n179\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares granted\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n49\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares earned\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(50)\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares forfeited\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\n\\nBalance at December 31, 2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n168\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares granted\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n111\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares earned\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(59)\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares forfeited\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(30)\\n\\n\\n\\nBalance at December 31, 2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n190\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares granted\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n211\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares earned\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(41)\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares forfeited\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(54)\\n\\n\\n\\nBalance at December 31, 2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n306\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nFor purposes of determining compensation expense, the fair value of each\\nperformance share is measured at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on the\\nprice of Frontier common stock as well as performance relative to the targets.

Total remaining unrecognized compensation cost associated with unvested\\nrestricted stock awards that is deferred at December 31, 2017 was $21 million and the\\nweighted average vesting period over which this cost is expected to be recognized is approximately\\n1.2 years.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have granted restricted stock awards to employees in the form of our\\ncommon stock. None of the restricted stock awards may be sold, assigned, pledged or otherwise transferred,\\nvoluntarily or involuntarily, by the employees until the restrictions lapse, subject to limited exceptions. The\\nrestrictions are time-based. Compensation expense, recognized in \"Selling, general and administrative\\nexpenses\", of $18\\nmillion, $18 million and\\n$20 million, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and\\n2015, respectively, has been recorded in connection with these grants.\\n\\ufeff\\nNon-Employee Directors\\' Compensation Plans\\nAs of October 1, 2013, stock units are credited to the director\\'s account in\\nan amount that is determined as follows: the total cash value of the fees payable to the director is divided by\\nthe closing price of Frontier common stock on the grant date of the units. Units are credited to the director\\'s\\naccount quarterly. Directors must also elect to convert the units to either common stock (convertible on a\\none-to-one basis) or cash upon retirement or death.\\n\\ufeff\\nDividends are paid on stock units held by directors at the same rate and at the same time as\\nwe pay dividends on shares of our common stock. Dividends on stock units are paid in the form of additional\\nstock units.\\n\\ufeff\\nThere were 9 directors\\nparticipating in the Director Plans during all or part of 2017. The total plan units earned were 94,034,\\n29,618, and 22,279 in 2017, 2016\\nand 2015,\\nrespectively.\\n\\ufeff\\nTo the extent directors elect to receive the distribution of their stock unit account in cash,\\nthey are considered liability-based awards. To the extent directors elect to receive the distribution of their\\nstock unit accounts in common stock, they are considered equity-based awards.

The TCJA, makes broad and complex changes to the U.S.\\ntax code. The TCJA reduces the corporate tax rate to 21%,\\neffective January 1, 2018.

SAB 118 provides a measurement period\\nthat should not extend beyond one year from the TCJA enactment date for companies to complete the accounting\\nunder ASC 740, Income Taxes. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those\\naspects of the TCJA for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a company\\'s\\naccounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable\\nestimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements.\\n\\ufeff\\nAs a result of the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate, we\\nrevalued our net deferred tax liability, as of December 31, 2017.

The pension plan and postretirement benefit plans are closed to\\nthe majority of our newly hired employees. The benefits are based on years of\\nservice and final average pay or career average pay. Contributions are made in amounts sufficient to meet ERISA\\nfunding requirements while considering tax deductibility. Plan assets are invested in a diversified portfolio\\nof equity and fixed-income securities and alternative investments.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe accounting results for pension and other postretirement benefit costs\\nand obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions applied in the determination of such amounts.\\nThese actuarial assumptions include the following: discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan\\nassets, future compensation increases, employee turnover, healthcare cost trend rates, expected retirement age,\\noptional form of benefit and mortality. We review these assumptions for changes annually with our independent\\nactuaries. We consider our discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to be\\nour most critical assumptions.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe discount rate is used to value, on a present value basis, our pension and other\\npostretirement benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date. The same rate is also used in the interest\\ncost component of the pension and postretirement benefit cost determination for the following year. The\\nmeasurement date used in the selection of our discount rate is the balance sheet date. Our discount rate\\nassumption is determined annually with assistance from our independent actuaries based on the pattern of\\nexpected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long-term, high quality corporate bonds\\nthat approximate the benefit obligation.\\n\\ufeff\\nAs of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we utilized an estimation technique that is based upon a settlement model\\n(Bond:Link) that permits us to closely match cash flows to the expected payments to participants. This rate can\\nchange from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields.\\n\\ufeff\\nAs a result of the technique described above, Frontier is utilizing a\\ndiscount rate of 3.70% as of December 31,\\n2017 for its qualified pension plan, compared to rates\\nof 4.10% and 4.50%\\nin 2016 and 2015, respectively. The discount rate for postretirement plans as of December 31,\\n2017 was a range of 3.70%\\nto 3.80% compared to a range of\\n4.10% to 4.30% in 2016 and 4.50%\\nto 4.70% in 2015.\\n\\n\\n\\nF-37\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nThe Pension Plan contains provisions that provide certain employees with\\nthe option of receiving a lump sum payment upon retirement. Frontier\\'s accounting policy is to record these\\npayments as a settlement only if, in the aggregate, they exceed the sum of the annual service and interest\\ncosts for the Pension Plan\\'s net periodic pension benefit cost. During year ended December 31, 2017, lump sum\\npension settlement payments to terminated or retired individuals amounted to $486 million, which exceeded the settlement threshold of $224 million, and as a result, Frontier recognized non-cash settlement charges\\ntotaling $83 million during 2017. The non-cash charge\\naccelerated the recognition of a portion of the previously unrecognized actuarial losses in the Pension Plan.\\nThese non-cash charges increased our recorded net loss and accumulated deficit, with an offset to accumulated\\nother comprehensive loss in shareholders\\' equity.\\n\\ufeff\\nAs a result of the CTF Acquisition, the Frontier Communications Pension Plan\\n(the Plan) was remeasured. This remeasurement resulted in a decrease in the discount rate from\\n4.50% at December 31, 2015 to 4.00%\\nat the date of the CTF Acquisition. This change in the discount rate resulted in a\\nremeasurement charge to other comprehensive income (loss) of $105 million during 2016.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied in the\\ndetermination of periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost as a reduction in the computation of the\\nexpense. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we considered published surveys of\\nexpected market returns, 10 and 20 year actual returns of various major indices, and our own historical 5 year,\\n10 year and 20 year investment returns. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on an\\nasset allocation assumption of 40% in long-duration fixed\\nincome securities, and 60% in equity securities and other\\ninvestments. We review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate. Our\\npension asset investment allocation decisions are made by the Retirement Investment\\n& Administration Committee (RIAC), a committee comprised of members of management, pursuant to a delegation\\nof authority by the Retirement Plan Committee of the Board of Directors. The RIAC is responsible for reporting\\nits actions to the Retirement Plan Committee. Asset allocation decisions take into account expected market\\nreturn assumptions of various asset classes as well as expected pension benefit payment streams. When analyzing\\nanticipated benefit payments, management considers both the absolute amount of the payments as well as the\\ntiming of such payments.

In addition, GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which\\nprioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe three input levels in the hierarchy of fair value

This program\\nprovides $332 million in annual support, including\\n$49 million in annual support related to the properties acquired in\\nthe CTF Acquisition, through 2020 to make available 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream broadband service to\\napproximately 774,000 households across certain of the\\n29 states where we now operate. To the extent we do not enable the\\nrequired number of households with 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream broadband service by the end of the CAF\\nPhase II term, we will be required to return a portion of the funds previously received.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn April 28, 2016, the FCC completed its inquiry into whether certain terms and conditions\\ncontained in specifically identified special access tariff pricing plans offered by four carriers, including\\nFrontier, are just and reasonable. The FCC held that certain of the tariff terms for business data TDM\\nservices, specifically DS1s and DS3s, were unreasonable. Specifically, the FCC struck down \"excessive\" early\\ntermination fees and \"all-or-nothing\" provisions. Frontier has revised its tariffs in accordance with the FCC\\'s\\nOrder. The FCC\\'s decision has no retroactive effect, and we anticipate no material impact to Frontier from\\nit.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe FCC deferred the issue of how its ruling will affect customers currently\\npurchasing services from these tariffs to a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. It is seeking comment on proposed\\nchanges to the way the FCC regulates traditional special access services and,\\non a proposal, to adopt pricing rules for\\nEthernet services in markets that are found to be \"noncompetitive.\" The potential impact to Frontier of this\\nproceeding is unknown, though any pending initiative could adversely affect our operations or financial\\nresults.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe are party to various legal proceedings (including individual, class and putative class\\nactions, governmental investigations) arising in the normal course of our business covering a wide range of\\nmatters and types of claims including, but not limited to, general contracts, billing disputes, rights of\\naccess, taxes and surcharges, consumer protection, advertising, trademark and patent infringement, employment,\\nregulatory, tort, claims of competitors and disputes with other carriers. Litigation is subject to uncertainty\\nand the outcome of individual matters is not predictable. However, we believe that the ultimate resolution of\\nall such matters, after considering insurance coverage or other indemnities to which we are entitled, will not\\nhave a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn October 2013, the California Attorney General\\'s Office notified certain Verizon companies,\\nincluding one of the subsidiaries that we acquired in the CTF Acquisition, of potential violations of\\nCalifornia state hazardous waste statutes primarily arising from the disposal of electronic components,\\nbatteries and aerosol cans at certain California facilities. We are cooperating with this investigation. We\\nhave accrued an amount for potential penalties that we deem to be probable and reasonably estimated, and we do\\nnot expect that any potential penalties, if ultimately incurred, will be material in comparison to the\\nestablished accrual.\\n\\n\\n\\nF-47\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nWe accrue an expense for pending litigation when we determine that an\\nunfavorable outcome is probable, and the amount of the loss\\ncan be reasonably estimated. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred. None of our existing accruals for\\npending matters, after considering insurance coverage, is material. We monitor our pending litigation for the\\npurpose of adjusting our accruals and revising our disclosures accordingly, when required. Litigation is,\\nhowever, subject to uncertainty, and the outcome of any particular matter is not predictable. We will\\nvigorously defend our interests in pending litigation, and as of this date, we believe that the ultimate\\nresolution of all such matters, after considering insurance coverage or other indemnities to which we are\\nentitled, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of\\noperations, or our cash flows.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe conduct certain of our operations in leased premises and also lease\\ncertain equipment and other assets pursuant to operating leases.

Sedgwick, a third-party claims administrator,\\nadministers the casualty claims and make claim payments on our behalf. We reimburse Sedgwick for such services\\nupon presentation of their invoice. However, to serve as our insurance carrier, AIG Insurance requires that we\\nestablish a letter of credit in their favor.

The equity interests of the\\nremaining subsidiaries of the Company are not pledged to secure the obligations under these debt\\nagreements.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn connection with the 2018 Credit Amendment, the Company expanded the security package to\\ninclude the pledge of the outstanding equity interests in certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company not\\npreviously pledged (together with the Original Pledged Subsidiaries, the \"Pledged Subsidiaries\").\\n\\ufeff\\nThe financial statements were prepared using Frontier\\'s historical basis in the assets and\\nliabilities of the Pledged Subsidiaries, and its combined financial statements include all revenue, costs,\\nassets, and liabilities directly attributable to the Pledged Subsidiaries. Historically, Frontier provided\\ncertain corporate services to the Pledged Subsidiaries and costs associated with these functions have been\\nallocated to the Pledged Subsidiaries. Management believes these expenses have been allocated using reasonable\\nallocation methodologies to the services provided, primarily based on relative percentage of total net sales,\\nrelative percentage of headcount, or specific identification.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe allocations may not reflect the expense the Pledged Subsidiaries would have incurred as a\\nstand-alone company for the periods presented. Actual costs that may have been incurred if the Pledged\\nSubsidiaries had been a stand-alone company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen\\norganizational structure, what functions were outsourced or performed by employees, and strategic decisions\\nmade in certain areas. The total shareholder\\'s equity represents Frontier\\'s interest in the Pledged\\nSubsidiaries\\' recorded net assets.\\n\\ufeff\\nAllocated operating expenses include corporate costs, employee benefits\\n(medical, dental and vision), 401(k) contributions, pension and postretirement benefits, stock-based\\ncompensation relating to restricted stock issuances, collections on receivables and acquisition and integration\\ncosts incurred by Frontier. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation expense, are allocated from Frontier primarily based on customer counts and\\nheadcount.\\n\\ufeff\\nTaxes are allocated from Frontier based on the Pledged Subsidiaries\\'\\nrelative contribution to the consolidated financial results.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe Pledged Subsidiaries are part of a centralized cash management system with Frontier in\\nwhich cash received by Frontier on Pledged Subsidiaries\\' behalf and cash disbursements made by Frontier on\\nPledged Subsidiaries\\' behalf are recorded through intercompany accounts. These transactions include receipts\\nand disbursements related to income taxes attributable to federal and state jurisdictions and capital\\nexpenditures, among others.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe following supplemental financial information presents the consolidating\\nbalance sheet information and statement of\\noperations information of the Pledged Subsidiaries, all\\nother Frontier entities, and the Pledged Subsidiaries and all other Frontier entities on a consolidated\\nbasis, as of and for the year ended December 31,\\n2017.

Service by the Indemnitee. The Indemnitee shall serve and/or continue to serve as a director or officer of Frontier faithfully\\nand to the best of the Indemnitee\\'s ability so long as the Indemnitee is duly elected or appointed and until\\nsuch time as the Indemnitee\\'s successor is elected and qualified or the Indemnitee is removed as permitted by\\napplicable law or tenders a resignation in writing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Indemnification and Advancement of\\nExpenses.

Action or Proceedings Other than an Action\\nby or in the Right of Frontier. Except as limited by Section 3 above, the Indemnitee\\nshall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin this Section if the Indemnitee was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or\\nwas or is otherwise involved in, any Proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of Frontier) by reason\\nof the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of Frontier or while\\na director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of Frontier is or was serving at the request of Frontier as a\\ndirector, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,\\ntrust, or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, or by reason of\\nanything done or not done by the Indemnitee in any such capacity. Pursuant to this Section, the Indemnitee\\nshall be indemnified against all expense, liability, and loss (including judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes,\\npenalties, amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of the Indemnitee, and Expenses) actually and reasonably\\nincurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding, if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a\\nmanner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of Frontier, and with\\nrespect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Indemnity in Proceedings by or in the Right\\nof Frontier. Except as limited by Section 3 above, the Indemnitee shall be entitled\\nto the indemnification rights provided in this Section if the Indemnitee was or is a party or is threatened to\\nbe made a party to, or was or is otherwise involved in, any Proceeding brought by or in the right of Frontier\\nto procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director, officer,\\nemployee, agent, or trustee of Frontier or while a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of Frontier\\nis or was serving at the request of Frontier as a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of another\\ncorporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including service with respect to\\nan employee benefit plan, or by reason of anything done or not done by the Indemnitee in any such capacity.\\nPursuant to this Section, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all expense, liability, and loss\\n(including judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, penalties, amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of the\\nIndemnitee, and Expenses) actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding\\nif the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not\\nopposed to the best interests of Frontier; provided, however, that no such indemnification shall be\\nmade in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which the DGCL expressly prohibits such indemnification by\\nreason of any adjudication of liability of the Indemnitee to Frontier, unless and only to the extent that the\\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such Proceeding was brought shall determine\\nupon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case,\\nthe Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification for such expense, liability, and loss as such court shall deem\\nproper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6. Indemnification for Costs, Charges, and\\nExpenses of Successful Party. Notwithstanding any limitations of Sections 3(c), 4,\\nand 5 above, to the extent that the Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in whole or in\\npart, in defense of any Proceeding, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, including, without\\nlimitation, the dismissal of any action without prejudice, or if it is ultimately determined, by final judicial\\ndecision of a court of competent jurisdiction from which there is no further right to appeal, that the\\nIndemnitee is otherwise entitled to be indemnified against Expenses, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified\\nagainst all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection therewith.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7. Partial Indemnification. If the Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by Frontier\\nfor some or a portion of the expense, liability, and loss (including judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes,\\npenalties, amounts paid in settlement by or on\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbehalf of the Indemnitee, and Expenses) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with\\nany Proceeding, or in connection with any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 11 to enforce\\nrights under this Agreement, but not, however, for all of the total amount thereof, Frontier shall nevertheless\\nindemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such expense, liability, and loss actually and reasonably incurred\\nto which the Indemnitee is entitled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8. Indemnification for Expenses of a\\nWitness. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the maximum\\nextent permitted by the DGCL, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification against all Expenses actually\\nand reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee or on the Indemnitee\\'s behalf if the Indemnitee appears as a witness\\nor otherwise incurs legal expenses as a result of or related to the Indemnitee\\'s service as a director or\\nofficer of Frontier, in any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute\\nresolution mechanism, inquiry, judicial, administrative, or legislative hearing, investigation, or any other\\nthreatened, pending, or completed proceeding, whether of a civil, criminal, administrative, legislative,\\ninvestigative, or other nature, to which the Indemnitee neither is, nor is threatened to be made, a\\nparty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9. Determination of Entitlement to\\nIndemnification. To receive indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee\\nshall submit a written request to the Chief Executive Officer or the Secretary of Frontier. Such request shall\\ninclude such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably\\nnecessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (the\\n\"Supporting Documentation\"). The Secretary of Frontier\\nshall promptly advise the Board of Directors in writing that the Indemnitee has requested indemnification. The\\ndetermination of the Indemnitee\\'s entitlement to indemnification shall be made by the following person or\\npersons who shall be empowered to make such determination: (a) a majority of the Disinterested Directors\\n(including by the Disinterested Director, if there is only one); (b) a majority of a committee of Disinterested\\nDirectors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors; (c) Independent Counsel, if a majority\\nof the Disinterested Directors so directs or there are no Disinterested Directors, in a written opinion to the\\nBoard of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee; (d) the stockholders of Frontier (but\\nonly if a majority of the Disinterested Directors determines that the issue of entitlement to indemnification\\nshould be submitted to the stockholders for their determination); (e) in the event that a Change in Control has\\noccurred and the Indemnitee so requests (in which case the Disinterested Directors shall be deemed to have so\\ndirected), by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be\\ndelivered to the Indemnitee; or (f) as provided in Section 10. In the event the determination of entitlement to\\nindemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel, a majority of the Disinterested Directors shall select\\nthe Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which the Indemnitee does not reasonably\\nobject; provided, however, that if a Change in Control has occurred or there are no\\nDisinterested Directors, the Indemnitee shall select such Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel\\nto which the Board of Directors does not reasonably object. Upon failure of the Disinterested Directors (or the\\nIndemnitee, in the event a Change in Control has occurred or there are no Disinterested Directors) to select\\nsuch Independent Counsel or upon objection by the Indemnitee or Board of Directors to the selection of\\nIndependent Counsel, such Independent Counsel shall be selected upon application to a court of competent\\njurisdiction. The determination of the Indemnitee\\'s entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later than\\n60 calendar days after receipt by Frontier of the written request therefor together with the Supporting\\nDocumentation, and unless a contrary determination is made, such indemnification shall be paid in full not\\nlater than five calendar days after such determination has been made, or is deemed to have been made pursuant\\nto Section 10. If the person\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmaking such determination shall determine that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification\\nas to part (but not all) of the application for indemnification, such person shall reasonably prorate such\\npartial indemnification among the claims, issues, or matters at issue at the time of the determination.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10. Presumptions and Effect of Certain\\nProceedings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in\\nthis Agreement, the Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification upon submission of a request\\nfor indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation, and thereafter in any determination or review\\nof any determination, and in any suit, arbitration or adjudication, Frontier shall have the burden of proof to\\novercome that presumption, including the burden of proof that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of\\nconduct described above and also the burden of proof on any of the issues which may be material to a\\ndetermination that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification. In any event, if the person or persons\\nempowered under Section 9 to determine entitlement to indemnification shall not have been appointed or shall\\nnot have made a determination within 60 calendar days after receipt by Frontier of the request therefor\\ntogether with the Supporting Documentation, the Indemnitee shall be deemed to be entitled to indemnification.\\nIn either case, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification, unless: (i) the Indemnitee\\nmisrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the\\nSupporting Documentation; or (ii) such indemnification is prohibited by law, in either case as ultimately\\ndetermined by final judicial decision of a court of competent jurisdiction from which there is no further right\\nto appeal, or, at the Indemnitee\\'s sole option, arbitration as provided in Section 11.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) The termination of any Proceeding, or of\\nany claim, issue, or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of\\nnolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself,\\nadversely affect the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification or create any presumption with respect to any\\nstandard of conduct or belief or any other matter which might form a basis for a determination that the\\nIndemnitee is not entitled to indemnification.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) With regard to the right to indemnification\\nfor Expenses: (i) if and to the extent that the Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise, in\\nwhole or in part, in defense of any Proceeding; (ii) if a Proceeding was terminated without a determination of\\nliability on the part of the Indemnitee with respect to any claim, issue, or matter therein or without any\\npayments in settlement or compromise being made by the Indemnitee with respect to a claim, issue, or matter\\ntherein; or (iii) if and to the extent that the Indemnitee was not a party to the Proceeding, the Indemnitee\\nshall be deemed to be entitled to indemnification, which entitlement shall not be defeated or diminished by any\\ndetermination which may be made pursuant to Section 9.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) The Indemnitee shall be presumptively\\nentitled to indemnification in all respects for any act, omission, or conduct taken or occurring which (whether\\nby condition or otherwise) is required, authorized, or approved by any order issued or other action by any\\ncommission or governmental body pursuant to any federal statute or state statute regulating Frontier or any of\\nits subsidiaries by reason of its status as a public utility or public utility holding company or by reason of\\nits activities as such. To the extent permitted by law, the presumption shall be conclusive on all parties with\\nrespect to acts, omissions, or conduct of the Indemnitee if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or\\nshe reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of Frontier or its subsidiaries. No\\npresumption adverse to the Indemnitee shall be drawn with respect to any act, omission, or conduct of the\\nIndemnitee if he or she acted in good faith and in\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of\\nFrontier or its subsidiaries taken or occurring in the absence of, or inconsistent with, any order issued or\\naction by any commission or governmental body.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11. Remedies of the Indemnitee in Cases of\\nDetermination Not to Indemnify or to Advance Expenses; Right to Bring Suit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) In the event that a determination is made\\npursuant to Section 9 that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder, or if payment is not\\ntimely made following a determination of entitlement to indemnification pursuant to Sections 9 or 10, or if an\\nadvancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 16, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter\\nseek an adjudication of his or her entitlement to payment either, at the Indemnitee\\'s sole option, in: (i) an\\nappropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction; or (ii) to the extent\\nconsistent with law, arbitration to be conducted by three arbitrators (or, if the dispute involves less than\\n$100,000, by a single arbitrator) pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any such suit\\nor arbitration shall be de novo and the Indemnitee shall\\nnot be prejudiced by reason of such adverse determination. Frontier shall not oppose the Indemnitee\\'s right to\\nseek any such adjudication or award in arbitration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) In any suit or arbitration brought by the\\nIndemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of Expenses hereunder, or in any suit\\nbrought by Frontier to recover an advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden\\nof proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under\\nthis Section 11 or otherwise shall be on Frontier. Neither the failure of Frontier (including the Disinterested\\nDirectors, a committee of Disinterested Directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a\\ndetermination prior to the commencement of a suit or arbitration regarding whether indemnification of the\\nIndemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the standard of conduct described\\nabove, nor an actual determination by Frontier (including the Disinterested Directors, a committee of\\nDisinterested Directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met the standard\\nof conduct described above shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct.\\nNeither a failure to make such a determination of entitlement nor an adverse determination of entitlement to\\nindemnification shall be a defense of Frontier in a suit or arbitration brought by the Indemnitee or a suit by\\nor on behalf of Frontier relating to indemnification or create any presumption that the indemnitee has not met\\nthe standard of conduct described above or is otherwise not entitled to indemnification. In any suit brought by\\nFrontier to recover an advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, Frontier shall be\\nentitled to recover such Expenses upon a final judicial decision of a court of competent jurisdiction from\\nwhich there is no further right to appeal that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct described\\nabove.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) If a determination shall have been made or\\ndeemed to have been made, pursuant to Sections 9 or 10, that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification,\\nFrontier shall be obligated to pay the amounts constituting such indemnification within five calendar days\\nafter such determination has been made or deemed to have been made, as required by Section 9, and shall be\\nconclusively bound by such determination, unless: (i) the Indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a\\nmaterial fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation; or (ii) such\\nindemnification is prohibited by law, in either case as ultimately determined by final judicial decision of a\\ncourt of competent jurisdiction from which there is no\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfurther right to appeal, or, at the Indemnitee\\'s sole option, arbitration as provided in\\nSection 11. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Frontier may bring suit, in an appropriate court in the State of\\nDelaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction, contesting the right of the Indemnitee to receive\\nIndemnification hereunder due to the occurrence of a circumstance described in clause (i) above or a\\nprohibition of law (both of which are herein referred to as a \"Disqualifying Circumstance\"). In either\\ninstance, if the Indemnitee shall elect, at his or her sole option, that such dispute shall be determined by\\narbitration (as provided in Section 19(d)(i)), the Indemnitee and Frontier shall submit the controversy to\\narbitration. In any such suit or arbitration, whether brought by the Indemnitee or Frontier, the Indemnitee\\nshall be entitled to indemnification unless Frontier can satisfy the burden of proof that indemnification is\\nprohibited by reason of a Disqualifying Circumstance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) Frontier shall be precluded from asserting\\nin any suit or arbitration commenced pursuant to Section 11 that the procedures and presumptions or any other\\nprovisions of this Agreement are not valid, binding, and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or\\nbefore any such arbitrator or arbitrators that Frontier is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12. Non-Exclusivity of\\nRights. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of Expenses provided by\\nthis Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right that the Indemnitee may now or hereafter\\nacquire under any applicable law, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors, provisions of a\\ncertificate or bylaws (including the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Frontier), or otherwise. The\\nIndemnitee is free to proceed under any of the rights available to him or her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n13. Expenses to Enforce\\nAgreement. In the event that the Indemnitee seeks a judicial adjudication of or an\\naward in arbitration to enforce his or her rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement,\\nor is otherwise involved in any adjudication or arbitration with respect to his or her rights under this\\nAgreement, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from Frontier, and shall be indemnified by Frontier\\nagainst, any Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such adjudication\\nor award in arbitration (including, but not limited to, any appellate proceedings) if the Indemnitee prevails\\nin such judicial adjudication or arbitration, to the fullest extent permitted by law. If it shall be determined\\nin such judicial adjudication or arbitration that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the\\nindemnification or advancement of Expenses sought, the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with\\nsuch judicial adjudication or arbitration shall be prorated accordingly. In any suit brought by Frontier to\\nrecover an advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, Frontier shall pay all Expenses\\nactually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such suit to the extent the Indemnitee\\nhas been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of such suit, to the fullest extent permitted by\\nlaw.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n14. Continuation of\\nIndemnity. All agreements and obligations of Frontier contained herein shall\\ncontinue during the period the Indemnitee is a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of Frontier or\\nwhile a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee is serving at the request of Frontier as a director,\\nofficer, employee, agent, or trustee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other\\nenterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, and shall continue thereafter with\\nrespect to any possible claims based on the fact that the Indemnitee was a director, officer, employee, agent,\\nor trustee of Frontier or was serving at the request of Frontier as a director, officer, employee, agent, or\\ntrustee of another corporation or of a\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npartnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including service with respect to an\\nemployee benefit plan. This Agreement shall be binding upon all successors and assigns of Frontier (including\\nany transferee of all or substantially all of its assets and any successor by merger or operation of law) and\\nshall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee\\'s heirs, executors, and administrators.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15. Notification; Selection of\\nCounsel. Promptly after receipt by the Indemnitee of notice of any Proceeding, the\\nIndemnitee shall, if a request for indemnification or an advancement of Expenses in respect thereof is to be\\nmade against Frontier under this Agreement, notify Frontier in writing of the commencement thereof; but the\\nomission so to notify Frontier shall not relieve it from any liability or obligation that it may have to the\\nIndemnitee.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section\\n15(b), Frontier may, if appropriate, assume the defense of a Proceeding, with legal counsel approved by the\\nIndemnitee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. With respect to a Proceeding, Frontier may\\nsatisfy its obligations under this Agreement by paying for single counsel for a group of indemnitees, and legal\\ncounsel may represent both the Indemnitee and Frontier (and/or any other indemnitees entitled to receive\\nadvancement of Expenses or indemnification from Frontier with respect to such matter), in each case unless: (i)\\nthe Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between Frontier and\\nthe Indemnitee or any other such indemnitees; or (ii) under the applicable standards of professional conduct\\nthen prevailing, such legal counsel would have a conflict of interest. Any counsel retained in accordance with\\nthe preceding sentence shall be approved by the Indemnitee (and any other such indemnitees), by majority vote\\nof indemnitees who are directors, president, or executive vice presidents of Frontier, which approval shall not\\nbe unreasonably withheld. If Frontier has directors\\' and officers\\' insurance, or other insurance, with a panel\\ncounsel requirement that may cover the matter for which advancement of Expenses or indemnification is sought,\\nthen such counsel shall be selected from among the panel counsel or other counsel approved by the insurers,\\nunless Frontier waives such requirement in writing.\\n(b) In any Proceeding brought by or in the\\nright of Frontier to procure a judgment in its favor, the Indemnitee (and/or any other indemnitees entitled to\\nreceive advancement of Expenses or indemnification from Frontier with respect to such matter) shall be entitled\\nto select single counsel of their choice to represent such group of indemnitees, and such counsel shall\\nrepresent the group of indemnitees unless: (i) the Indemnitee or another indemnitee shall have reasonably\\nconcluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Indemnitee or any other such indemnitees; or\\n(ii) under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, such legal counsel would have a\\nconflict of interest. Counsel for the group of indemnitees shall be selected and approved by majority vote of\\nthe indemnitees who are directors, president, or executive vice presidents of Frontier, which approval shall\\nnot be unreasonably withheld. If Frontier has directors\\' and officers\\' insurance, or other insurance, with a\\npanel counsel requirement that may cover the matter for which advancement of Expenses or indemnification is\\nsought, then such counsel shall be selected from among the panel counsel or other counsel approved by the\\ninsurers, unless Frontier waives such requirement in writing. Frontier shall not be entitled to assume the\\ndefense of any Proceeding brought by or in the right of Frontier to procure a judgment in its favor.\\n(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this\\nAgreement, the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ the Indemnitee\\'s own counsel in any Proceeding, but,\\nexcept as set forth in Sections 15(a) or 15(b) hereof, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the\\nexpense of the\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndemnitee unless: (i) there is a conflict of interest as described above; or (ii) the\\nemployment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by Frontier.\\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this\\nAgreement, Frontier shall not be liable to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid\\nin settlement of any Proceeding effected without Frontier\\'s written consent. Frontier shall not settle any\\nProceeding in any manner that would impose any penalty or limitation on or disclosure obligation with respect\\nto the Indemnitee without the Indemnitee\\'s written consent, or that would directly or indirectly constitute or\\nimpose any admission or acknowledgment of fault or culpability with respect to the Indemnitee without the\\nIndemnitee\\'s written consent. Neither Frontier nor the Indemnitee shall unreasonably withhold its consent to\\nany proposed settlement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n16. Advancement of Expenses. All Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in defending any Proceeding described in Section 4 or 5 shall\\nbe paid by Frontier in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding at the request of the Indemnitee. To\\nreceive an advancement of Expenses under this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall submit a written request to the\\nChief Executive Officer or the Secretary of Frontier. Such request shall reasonably evidence the Expenses\\nincurred or about to be incurred by the Indemnitee and, if required by law at the time of such advancement,\\nshall include or be accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay the amounts\\nadvanced if it shall ultimately be determined, by final judicial decision of a court of competent jurisdiction\\nfrom which there is no further right to appeal, that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such\\nExpenses by Frontier as provided by this Agreement or otherwise. The Indemnitee\\'s undertaking to repay any such\\namounts is not required to be secured. Each such advancement of Expenses shall be made within 20 calendar days\\nafter receipt by Frontier of such written request. The Indemnitee\\'s entitlement to Expenses under this\\nAgreement shall include those incurred in connection with any action, suit, or proceeding by the Indemnitee\\nseeking an adjudication or award in arbitration pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement (including the\\nenforcement of this provision) to the extent the court or arbitrator shall determine that the Indemnitee is\\nentitled to an advancement of Expenses hereunder.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n17. Severability. If\\nany provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any\\nreason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement\\n(including, without limitation, all portions of any paragraphs of this Agreement containing any such provision\\nheld to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that are not by themselves invalid, illegal, or unenforceable)\\nshall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of\\nthis Agreement (including, without limitation, all portions of any paragraph of this Agreement containing any\\nsuch provision held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal, or\\nunenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent of the parties that Frontier provide\\nprotection to the Indemnitee to the fullest enforceable extent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n18.

Other Provisions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) This Agreement and all disputes or\\ncontroversies arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance\\nwith, the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the laws of any other jurisdiction that\\nmight be applied because of conflicts of laws principles of the State of Delaware.\\n(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this\\nAgreement, in the event that the Indemnitee elects, as an alternative to the procedures specified in this\\nAgreement, to follow one of the procedures authorized by applicable corporate law or statute to enforce his or\\nher rights under this Agreement and notifies Frontier of his or her election, Frontier agrees to follow the\\nprocedure so elected by the Indemnitee. If in accordance with the preceding sentence, the procedure therefor\\ncontemplated herein or the procedure elected by the Indemnitee in any specific circumstances (or such election\\nby the Indemnitee) shall be invalid or ineffective in bringing about a valid and binding determination of the\\nentitlement of the Indemnitee to indemnification or advancement of Expenses under this Agreement, the most\\nnearly comparable procedure authorized by applicable corporate law or statute shall be followed by Frontier and\\nthe Indemnitee.\\n(c) Frontier may create a trust fund, grant a\\nsecurity interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit, surety bonds and/or\\nother similar arrangements) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification\\nor advancement of Expenses pursuant to this Agreement.\\n(d) This Agreement may be executed in two or\\nmore counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and shall become effective when\\none or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party.\\n(e) This Agreement shall not be deemed an\\nemployment contract between Frontier and any Indemnitee who is an officer of Frontier, and, if the Indemnitee\\nis an officer of Frontier, the Indemnitee specifically acknowledges that the Indemnitee may be discharged at\\nany time for any reason, with or without cause, and with or without severance compensation, except as may be\\notherwise provided in a separate written contract between the Indemnitee and Frontier.\\n(f) In the event of payment under this\\nAgreement, Frontier shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the\\nIndemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such\\nrights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable Frontier effectively to bring suit to\\nenforce such rights.\\n(g) This Agreement may not be amended,\\nmodified, or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in\\nwriting specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each party. No failure or delay of\\neither party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or\\npartial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such\\nright or power, or any course of conduct, shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise\\nof any other right or power.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, Frontier and the Indemnitee have caused this Agreement to be executed as\\nof the date first written above.\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS

Business\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) is a provider of communications services in the\\nUnited States, with approximately 4.9 million customers, 3.9 million broadband subscribers and 22,700\\nemployees, operating in 29 states. In recent years, Frontier has completed multiple acquisitions. On April 1,\\n2016, we acquired the wireline operations of Verizon Communications, Inc. in California, Texas and Florida for\\na purchase price of $10,540 million in cash and assumed debt.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier\\'s Service Territories\\n\\ufeff\\n\\nHow We Serve Our Customers\\n\\ufeff\\nWe conduct business with both consumer and commercial customers.\\n\\ufeff\\nConsumer. We provide broadband, video, voice and\\nother services and products to our consumer customers. We deliver these services generally over a combination\\nof fiber and copper-based networks.\\n\\ufeff\\nCommercial (small, medium and large enterprise\\nbusiness (SME) as well as wholesale customers).\\n\\ufeff\\nCommercial. We provide a broad range of services to\\nour SME customers, including broadband service, Ethernet service, traditional circuit-based services (TDM\\nservices) and voice services. We also offer advanced hardware and network solutions and services.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\no\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLarger Enterprise: Fortune 1000, multi-location\\ncompanies, large government entities, large educational institutions, and non-profits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\no\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMedium Business: Single or multi-location\\ncompanies and mid-sized government entities, educational institutions and non-profits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\no\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSmall Business: Mostly single-location businesses,\\nthe smaller of which have purchase patterns similar to consumer customers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\no\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWholesale: Wholesale\\ncustomers are often referred to as carriers or service providers and include national operators such as\\nAT&T and Verizon; Local Exchange Companies that need to access locations within Frontier\\'s footprint to\\noffer local services; and wireless carriers and integrated carriers that offer a variety of services across all of these categories. Wholesale customers buy\\nboth voice and data services to supplement their own network infrastructure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nServices and Products\\n\\ufeff\\nWe offer a broad portfolio of communications services for consumer and commercial customers.\\nThese services are offered on either a standalone basis or in a bundled package, depending on each customer\\'s\\nneeds.\\n\\ufeff\\nData and Internet services. We offer a\\ncomprehensive range of broadband and networking services. The principal consumer service we provide is\\nbroadband internet service. Commercial services include a complete portfolio of Ethernet services, dedicated\\ninternet, software defined wide area network (SDWAN), multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), time division\\nmultiplexing (TDM) data transport services and optical transport services. These services are all supported by\\n24/7 technical support and an advanced network operations center. We also offer wireless broadband services\\n(using unlicensed spectrum) in select markets utilizing networks that we own or operate.\\n\\ufeff\\nVideo services. We offer video services under\\nFiOS® brand in portions of California, Texas, Florida,\\nIndiana, Oregon and Washington, and the VantageTM brand in\\nportions of Connecticut, North Carolina, South Carolina, Minnesota, Illinois, New York, and Ohio. We also offer\\nsatellite TV video service to our customers under an agency relationship with DISH® in all of our markets.\\n\\ufeff\\nVoice services. We provide voice services,\\nincluding data-based VoIP, long-distance and voice messaging services, to consumer and commercial customers in\\nall of our markets. These services are billed monthly in advance. Long-distance service to and from points\\noutside our operating properties are provided by interconnection with the facilities of interexchange carriers.\\nOur long-distance services are billed in advance for unlimited use service, and billed in arrears for services\\non a per minute-of-use basis.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe also offer packages of communications services. These packages permit customers to bundle\\ntheir products and services, including voice service, video and Internet services, and other product\\nofferings.\\nAccess services. We offer a range of access\\nservices. Our switched access services allow other carriers to use our facilities to originate and terminate\\ntheir local and long-distance voice traffic. These services are generally offered on a month-to-month basis and\\nthe service is billed primarily on a minutes-of-use basis. Switched access charges are based on access rates\\nfiled with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for interstate services and with the\\nrespective state regulatory agency for intrastate services. See \"Regulatory Environment\" below.\\nAdvanced Hardware and Network Solutions. We offer\\nour SME customers various hardware and network solutions utilizing cloud functionality and Customer Premise\\nEquipment (CPE). We offer third-party communications equipment tailored to their specific business needs by\\npartnering with Mitel, Cisco, Ingram Micro, Airbus, Avaya,\\nHewlett Packard, Adtran and other equipment manufacturers. CPE is typically sold in conjunction with voice,\\ndata and Internet services, and may also be sold on a standalone basis.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier Operating Strategies\\n\\ufeff\\nConsumer Business\\n\\ufeff\\nImprove Customer Experience and Retention. We\\nprovide multiple service and product options to our\\nconsumer customers. Our strategy is to foster relationships\\nand loyalty throughout the customer lifecycle in order to improve experiences, reduce churn and grow revenue.\\nOur plan to retain customers includes providing easier access to account services and trouble-shooting options\\nthrough online portals and user interfaces. We incorporate and utilize customer feedback to improve our product\\nofferings with the goal of improving the overall customer experience for our subscribers. We focus and refine\\nour marketing strategy for sales and retention to drive further improvement in the business.\\n\\ufeff\\nNew Customer Acquisition. We focus on broadband as the core growth\\ncomponent of our service offerings, either bundled with our voice and/or video services, or\\non a standalone basis. We seek to attract and retain a greater number of customers\\nand increase average revenue per customer (ARPC). We are committed to\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\ngrowing our customer base through providing higher broadband speeds and capacity that will\\nenable us to reach new markets, target new customers, and grow the business while maximizing our full\\nfootprint.\\n\\ufeff\\nImprove Revenue Trends. As we expand the range of\\nservices we offer customers, increase the capabilities of our networks, and increase the penetration of our\\nservices, we increase our revenue opportunity and are better positioned to increase the average amount of\\nrevenue we can receive from a customer.\\n\\ufeff\\nCommercial Business\\n\\ufeff\\nImprove Revenue Trends. Our strategy is to achieve\\nrevenue growth in our Commercial business through the acquisition of new customers, increasing the penetration\\nof services with existing customers, and improved retention of existing customers.\\n\\ufeff\\nOffer a Competitive Product Portfolio. We offer both\\ntraditional services as well as an expanding range of advanced, packet-based services, such as Ethernet, SDWAN,\\nUnified Communication as a Service (UCaaS) cloud-based connectivity for our large enterprise customers, and\\nmore cost-effective integrated voice and data services for our medium and small business customers.\\n\\ufeff\\nNew Customer Acquisition. We have increased our\\nsales force with an emphasis on adding new customers and increasing penetration of existing customers,\\nparticularly in areas where we have a robust fiber network.\\n\\ufeff\\nImprove Customer Experience and Retention. We plan\\nto grow our revenues in the commercial sector through increased retention and deepening of existing customer\\nrelationships. The proper alignment of our sales force, service personnel, and resources will enable us to\\nprovide excellent service to our existing enterprise,\\nmedium and small business customers, while obtaining the greatest\\nopportunities for revenue growth and expansion.\\n\\ufeff\\nCompany-Wide\\n\\ufeff\\nInvest in our Network through Capital Expenditures. Our investment focus is the enhancement of our existing network and the expansion of fiber-based\\ninfrastructure in our network. We continue to upgrade network hardware, expand\\ntransport capacity of our middle-mile\\nand data backbone, and enhance our video capabilities. Similarly, we are focused on enhancing our premium Ethernet service offerings across our network for our\\ncommercial customers.\\n\\ufeff\\nImprove Productivity and Operational Efficiency. We continuously engage in productivity\\ninitiatives with a focus on simplifying our processes, eliminating redundancies and further\\nreducing our cost structure while improving our customer service capabilities. We continue to migrate our\\nnetwork and systems to common operating platforms in order to increase efficiency and we have been migrating\\ntraffic to a common architecture to eliminate duplication.\\n\\ufeff\\nNetwork Architecture and Technology\\n\\ufeff\\nOur local exchange carrier networks consist of host central office and remote\\nsites, primarily equipped with digital and Internet\\nProtocol switches. The outside plant consists of transport and\\ndistribution delivery networks connecting our host central office with remote central offices and ultimately\\nwith our customers. We own fiber optic and copper cable, which have been deployed in our networks and are the\\nprimary transport technologies between our host and remote central offices and interconnection points with\\nother incumbent carriers.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have expanded and enhanced our fiber optic and copper transport systems to\\nsupport increasing demand for high bandwidth transport services. We routinely enhance our network and upgrade\\nwith the latest Internet Protocol Transport and routing\\nequipment, Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers (ROADM) transport systems, Very High Bit-Rate Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL)\\nbroadband equipment, and VoIP switches. These systems support advanced services such as Ethernet, Dedicated\\nInternet, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) transport, VoIP, and SDWAN. The network is designed with\\nredundancy and auto-failover capability on our major circuits.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe connect to households and business locations in our service territory using a combination of\\nfiber optic and copper technologies. In some cases we provide direct fiber into a residence or a business\\npremises. In other cases a location is served with a hybrid combination of fiber and copper. Residences in our\\nservice territory are served by fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) and by fiber-to-the-node (FTTN), meaning fiber carries\\nthe traffic to an intermediate location where the\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nsignals are converted to copper wire for the final delivery to the household.\\nWe provide data, video, and voice services to customers over both of these architectures. Additionally, fixed wireless broadband (FWB) will play an important part of our future broadband\\nstrategy and could be deployed for some business Ethernet\\nservices. FWB is delivered by the use of an antenna on\\na Frontier base location\\nand another antenna at the customer location.\\n\\ufeff\\nRapid and significant changes in technology are occurring in the\\ncommunications industry. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to\\ntechnological changes. We believe that our next generation network architecture strategy will enable us to\\nrespond to these ongoing technological changes efficiently. In addition, we anticipate reducing costs through\\nthe sharing of best practices across operations, centralization or standardization of functions and processes,\\nand deployment of technologies and systems that provide for greater efficiencies and profitability.\\nWe will continue to make strategic enhancements to our network, with a focus on higher\\nreturn investments.\\n\\ufeff\\nCompetitive Positioning\\n\\ufeff\\nCompetition for consumer customers comes from cable operators, wireless carriers and online\\nvideo providers, among others.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCable operators: In a majority of our markets,\\ncable operators offer high speed Internet, video and voice services similar to ours, and compete with us\\naggressively on speed and price by marketing their offerings with significant promotional period\\npricing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWireless carriers: Wireless operators primarily\\ncompete with us for broadband, video, and voice services in our markets by offering increasingly larger data\\npackages to mobile customers. The percentage of homes with a landline telephone has been declining, a trend we\\nexpect will continue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline video providers: Many consumers are opting\\nfor internet-delivered video services (Over the Top, or OTT) through online\\nservice providers rather than traditional, multi-channel video. In response, we have\\nmade investments in our network to deliver OTT video content to consumers who might not opt for traditional\\nvideo services. The percentage of homes with a video product has been declining, a trend we expect will\\ncontinue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nMany consumer customers prefer to bundle their voice, data, Internet and\\nvideo services with a single provider. In areas where we do not directly offer a network-based video service, we offer satellite TV video service through DISH. This\\ncan positively impact acquisition of new customers and retention of existing customers, representing a critical\\nfactor for the attachment of video, broadband and voice products. As of December 31, 2017, 50% of our consumer customers subscribed to at least\\ntwo service offerings, and 17% subscribed to at least three\\nservice offerings.\\n\\ufeff\\nCompetition for commercial customers comes from telecommunications providers,\\ncable operators, Competitive Local Exchange Companies and\\nother enterprises, some of which are substantially larger than us. As compared to our consumer customers, these\\ncustomers often require more sophisticated and more data-centered solutions (e.g., IP PBX, E911 networks,\\nEthernet and SIP trunking).\\n\\ufeff\\nIn order to remain competitive, we continue to evolve our product offerings to stay current\\nwith the changing needs of the market, to provide strong customer service and support, to invest in our network\\nso we maintain adequate capacity and can deliver new capabilities as needed, and to package our offerings to\\nmake them attractive to customers.\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nRegulatory Environment\\n\\ufeff\\nSome of our operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and various state regulatory\\nagencies, often called public service or utility commissions. We expect federal and state lawmakers, the FCC\\nand the state regulatory agencies to continue to revise the statutes and regulations governing communications\\nservices.\\nRegulation of our business\\nWe are subject to federal, state and local regulation and we have various\\nregulatory authorizations for our regulated service offerings. At the federal level, the FCC generally\\nexercises jurisdiction over information services, interstate or international telecommunications services and\\nover facilities to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate interstate or international\\nservices. State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications\\nservices and the facilities used to provide, originate or terminate those services. Most of our local exchange\\ncompanies operate as incumbent carriers in the states in which they operate and are certified in those states\\nto provide local telecommunications services. Certain federal and state agencies,\\nincluding attorneys general, monitor and exercise oversight related to consumer protection issues.\\nIn addition, local governments often regulate the public rights-of-way necessary to install\\nand operate networks and may require service providers to obtain licenses or\\nfranchises regulating their use of public rights-of-way. Municipalities and other local government agencies\\nalso may regulate other limited aspects of our business, by requiring us to obtain cable franchises and\\nconstruction permits and to abide by applicable building codes.\\nSome states\\' regulatory agencies have substantial oversight over incumbent telephone companies,\\nand their interconnection with competitive providers and provision of non-discriminatory network access to\\ncertain network elements to them. Under the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, state regulatory\\ncommissions have jurisdiction to arbitrate and review interconnection disputes and agreements between incumbent\\ntelephone companies and competitive local exchange carriers, in accordance with rules set by the FCC. The FCC\\nand some state regulatory commissions also impose fees on providers of telecommunications services to support\\nstate universal service programs. Many of the states in which we operate require prior approvals or\\nnotifications for certain acquisitions and transfers of assets, customers, or ownership of regulated\\nentities.\\n\\ufeff\\nAdditionally, in some states we are subject to operating restrictions and minimum\\nservice quality standards. Failure\\nto meet such restrictions may result in penalties. We also are required to report certain financial\\ninformation. At the federal level and in a number of the states in which we operate, we are subject to price\\ncap or incentive regulation plans under which prices for regulated services are capped. Some of these plans\\nhave limited terms and, as they expire, we may need to renegotiate with various states. These negotiations\\ncould impact rates, service quality and/or infrastructure requirements, which could also impact our earnings\\nand capital expenditures. In other states in which we operate, we are subject to rate of return regulation that\\nlimits levels of earnings and returns on investments. Approximately 19% of our total access lines at December 31, 2017 are in state jurisdictions\\nunder the rate of return regulatory model. We continue to advocate for no or reduced regulation with various\\nregulatory agencies in those states. In some of the states we operate in we have already been successful in\\nreducing or eliminating price regulation on end-user services.\\n\\ufeff\\nFederal Regulatory Environment\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier, along with all telecommunications providers, is subject to FCC rules governing\\nprivacy of specified customer information. Among other things, these rules obligate carriers to implement\\nprocedures to: protect specified customer information from inappropriate disclosure; obtain customer permission\\nto use specified information in marketing; authenticate customers before disclosing account information; and\\nannually certify compliance with the FCC\\'s rules. Although most of these regulations are generally consistent\\nwith our business plans, they may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.\\n\\ufeff\\nSome regulations are, or could in the future be, the subject of judicial proceedings,\\nlegislative hearings and administrative proposals or challenges that could change the manner in which the\\nentire industry operates. Neither the outcome of any of these developments, nor their potential impact on us,\\ncan be predicted at this time. Regulation can change rapidly in the communications industry, and such changes\\nmay have an adverse effect on us.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe current status of material regulatory initiatives is as follows:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nFederal High-Cost Subsidies: The FCC has adopted\\nrules changing the eligibility requirements for federal subsidies offered to wireline carriers providing\\nservice to high-cost, low-density markets, as well as the amounts of such subsidies, as follows:\\n\\ufeff\\nConnect America Fund (CAF): On November 18, 2011, the\\nFCC adopted the Universal Service Fund (USF)/Intercarrier Compensation (ICC) Report and Order (the 2011 Order),\\nwhich changed how federal subsidies are calculated and disbursed, and began the transition of the high-cost\\ncomponent of the Federal USF, which supported voice services in high-cost areas, to the CAF, which supports\\nbroadband deployment in high-cost areas. Frontier received $133 million from 2012 through 2014 across two\\nrounds of CAF Phase I funding to make broadband available to approximately 194,600 previously unserved or\\nunderserved locations. We completed deployment of broadband service to the first round of CAF Phase I\\nhouseholds in 2015 and to the second round of CAF Phase I locations in March 2017 as required by the FCC\\nrules.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn April 29, 2015, the FCC released offers of support to price cap carriers\\nunder the CAF Phase II program. The intent of these offers is to provide long-term support for carriers for\\nestablishing and providing broadband service with at least 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream speeds in high\\ncost areas unserved by a competitor. Frontier accepted the CAF Phase II offer in 29 states, including our CTF\\nproperties, which provides for $332 million in annual support through 2020, and a commitment to make broadband\\navailable to approximately 774,000 households. CAF Phase II support is a successor to the approximately $156\\nmillion in annual USF frozen high cost support that Frontier had been receiving prior to the CTF acquisition,\\nand the $42 million in annual transitional USF frozen high cost support that Verizon had been receiving in\\nCalifornia and Texas. In addition to the annual support levels, these amounts also include frozen support\\nphasedown amounts in states where the annual CAF II funding is less than the prior annual frozen high cost\\nsupport funding. The frozen support phasedown support was $17 million in 2017 and is expected to be $9 million\\nin 2018.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn 2017, the FCC adopted a competitive bidding process to distribute approximately $200 million\\nper year in CAF Phase II funding in those high-cost areas where price cap carriers declined the FCC\\'s offer of\\nsupport, possibly presenting a new support and deployment opportunity. The FCC released the eligible areas in\\nDecember 2017 but the competitive bidding process has not yet been fully finalized. Therefore, Frontier is\\nunable to determine whether it will participate in any competitive bid process at this time.\\n\\ufeff\\nIntercarrier Compensation: In the 2011 Order, the FCC\\nalso reformed Intercarrier Compensation, which is the payment framework that governs how carriers compensate\\neach other for the exchange of interstate switched traffic, and began a multi-year transition to the new rates.\\nThe 2011 Order provided for the gradual elimination of effectively all terminating traffic charges by July\\n2017. Frontier\\'s switched access\\nrevenue declined sequentially in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting the rate reductions mandated by the 2011\\nOrder, and we anticipate that we have experienced nearly all of the rate decline related to the 2011 Order.\\nFrontier has been able to recover a significant portion of those lost revenues through end user rates and other\\nreplacement support mechanisms, a trend we expect will continue. There are no longer any active Intercarrier\\nCompensation-related challenges to the 2011 Order. However, the 2011 Order did not resolve all questions on\\noriginating access rates. The FCC continues to consider the possibility of a transition of originating access\\nrates, although the impact on Frontier, if any, is unknown at this time. Our total\\nrevenue for Intercarrier Compensation was $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\\n\\ufeff\\nSpecial Access: In April 2016, the FCC released a\\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking on special access or \"business data\" services. It sought comment on proposed\\nchanges to the way the FCC regulates traditional special access services based on market competition, and on a\\nproposal to adopt pricing rules for Ethernet services in markets that are found to be \"noncompetitive.\" In\\nAugust 2017, the FCC\\'s decision in this proceeding, which deregulates the market for end user special access\\nservices where the market is determined to be competitive and deregulates the transport market nationwide,\\nbecame effective. This decision is generally favorable in that it gives Frontier more flexibility to operate\\nits business in a deregulated fashion like its competitors in the market. Frontier is in the process of\\nimplementing various aspects of this decision and otherwise adjusting its rates on select business data service\\nelements in response to market conditions. Some aspects of the decision are under appeal by stakeholders,\\nincluding Frontier. Whether the appeals will be successful on any grounds is unknown.\\n\\ufeff\\nIntrastate Services: Some state regulatory\\ncommissions regulate some of the rates ILECs charge for intrastate services, including originating switched\\naccess rates for intrastate access services paid by providers of intrastate long-distance services. Some states also have their own open proceedings to address\\nreform to originating intrastate access charges and other intercarrier compensation and state universal service\\nfunds. Although the FCC has pre-empted state jurisdiction on most access charges, some states could consider\\nmoving forward with their proceedings.\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nWe cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on\\nour subsidy or switched access revenues. Our total revenue for Intrastate switched\\naccess services was $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, spread across all the states we\\nserve.\\n\\ufeff\\nCurrent and Potential Internet Regulatory Obligations and Privacy: In December 2017 the FCC voted to overturn the FCC\\'s 2015 decision in which it had asserted jurisdiction over broadband service, declared broadband a \"Title II\" telecommunications service,\\nand imposed rules to \"preserve a Free and Open Internet\" (i.e., net neutrality). Specifically, the FCC voted to\\neliminate explicit bans on blocking, throttling and paid prioritization in favor of requiring Internet service\\nproviders (ISPs) to be fully transparent about their practices. Both the FCC and Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\\nwill now have a role in ensuring that the ISPs are managing their network in the manner in which they publicly\\nstate they are.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe December 2017 decision also puts ISPs on an equal footing with other\\nonline web companies with respect to privacy rules, with the FTC being the lead agency on privacy enforcement.\\nThis decision follows Congress\\'s March 2017 action under the Congressional Review Act to vacate the 2015 rules\\nthat created a separate and more onerous privacy regime for ISPs than other online web companies. Frontier\\'s\\nInternet service will now be subject to the same privacy rules as online web companies, including disclosure of\\nits practices to consumers, which is Frontier\\'s current\\npractice.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe December 2017 ruling is not yet effective and will likely be appealed\\nin court. Meanwhile, the 2015 ruling is still under appeal,\\nthough it now appears moot. Frontier continues to comply with the existing regulatory requirements, and it is\\nunclear whether the pending or future appeals will have any impact on the regulatory structure.\\n\\ufeff\\nVideo programming\\n\\ufeff\\nFederal, state and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry. Our FiOS\\nand Vantage video services are subject to, among other things: subscriber privacy regulations; requirements\\nthat we carry a local broadcast station or obtain consent to carry a local or distant broadcast station; rules\\nfor franchise renewals and transfers; the manner in which program packages are marketed to subscribers; and\\nprogram access requirements.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe provide video programming in some of our markets in California, Connecticut, Florida,\\nIllinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas and Washington\\npursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by state and local franchising authorities.\\nMost franchises are subject to termination proceedings in the event of a material breach. In addition, most\\nfranchises require payment of a franchise fee as a requirement to the granting of authority.\\n\\ufeff\\nMany franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as\\nspecific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. In many cases, franchises are\\nterminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions set forth in the franchise agreement\\ngoverning system operations. We believe that we are in compliance and meeting all material standards and\\nrequirements. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms of at least ten years and must be periodically\\nrenewed. Local franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the\\nprospective operating proposal is considered inadequate.\\n\\ufeff\\nEnvironmental regulation\\n\\ufeff\\nThe local exchange carrier subsidiaries we operate are subject to federal, state and local laws\\nand regulations governing the use, storage, disposal of, and exposure to hazardous materials, the release of\\npollutants into the environment and the remediation of contamination. As an owner and former owner of property,\\nwe are subject to environmental laws that could impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup at contaminated\\nsites, including sites formerly owned by us, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the activity that\\nresulted in contamination. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable\\nenvironmental laws and regulations.\\n\\ufeff\\nSegment Information\\n\\ufeff\\nWe currently operate in one reportable segment.\\n\\ufeff\\nFinancial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have no foreign operations.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\ufeff\\nThe dollar amount of our order backlog is not a\\nsignificant consideration in our business and is not a meaningful metric for\\nus. We have no material contracts or subcontracts that may be subject to renegotiation\\nof profits or termination at the election of the federal government.\\n\\ufeff\\nIntellectual Property\\n\\ufeff\\nWe believe that we have the trademarks, trade names and intellectual property licenses that are\\nnecessary for the operation of our business.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe own or have the rights to use various trademarks, service marks and trade\\nnames referred to in this report.

Other trademarks, trade names or service\\nmarks appearing in this report are the property of their\\nrespective owners.\\n\\ufeff\\nEmployees\\n\\ufeff\\nAs of December 31, 2017, we\\nhad approximately 22,700 employees, as compared to approximately 28,300\\nemployees as of December 31, 2016.\\nDuring 2017, reduction in workforce activities resulted in the severance of approximately\\n1,300 employees. Approximately 16,000 of our total employees are represented by unions as of\\nDecember 31, 2017. The number of employees covered by a\\ncollective bargaining agreement that expired in 2017, but have been extended and are still effective for\\n2018, is approximately 1,400. The number of employees\\ncovered by collective bargaining agreements that expire in 2018 is approximately 4,300.

Risk Factors\\n\\ufeff\\nBefore you make an investment decision with respect to any of our securities, you should\\ncarefully consider all the information we have included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent\\nfilings with the SEC. In particular, you should carefully consider the risk factors described below and the\\nrisks and uncertainties related to \"Forward-Looking Statements,\" any of which could materially adversely affect\\nour business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which\\nforward-looking statements are made in this annual report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not\\nthe only ones facing Frontier. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we\\ncurrently deem immaterial or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions, may also\\nadversely affect our business and operations. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the\\nbalance of this annual report, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in\\nthis report.\\n\\ufeff\\nRisks Related to Our Business\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have experienced declining revenues and may experience further declines in our revenues\\ngoing forward.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have experienced declining revenues as a result of declining voice services revenues, lower\\nswitched and nonswitched access revenues and declining video and data services revenues. Such declines have\\nbeen driven primarily by customer losses, changing technology and consumer behavior (such as wireless\\ndisplacement of wireline use, e-mail use, instant messaging and increasing use of VoIP), increased competition,\\nregulatory constraints and financial decisions by governmental authorities. There can be no assurances that we\\nwill be able to stabilize or increase our revenues in the future. Future declines in our revenues could\\nmaterially and adversely impact our ability to execute on our business strategy, comply with our financial\\ncovenants, repay our debts as they become due, negotiate with third parties or attract and retain\\nemployees.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe may be unable to stabilize or grow our revenues and cash flows despite the initiatives we\\nhave implemented.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe must produce adequate revenues and operating cash flows that, when combined with cash on hand and funds available\\nunder our revolving credit facility and other financings, will be sufficient to service our debt, fund our\\ncapital expenditures, pay our taxes, and fund our pension\\nand other employee benefit obligations. We have experienced\\nrevenue declines in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior years. While we have identified potential areas of\\nopportunity and implemented several revenue and cost initiatives, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful or that these initiatives will improve our financial position or our results of\\noperations.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe face intense competition.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe communications industry is extremely competitive. Through mergers and\\nvarious service expansion strategies, service providers are striving to provide integrated solutions both\\nwithin and across geographic markets. Our competitors include competitive local exchange carriers,\\nInternet service providers, wireless companies,\\nOTT, VoIP providers and cable companies, some of which may be\\nsubject to less regulation than we are. These entities may provide services competitive with the services that we\\noffer or intend to introduce. For example, our competitors may seek to introduce networks in our legacy markets\\nthat are competitive with or superior to our copper-based networks in those markets. We also believe that\\nwireless and cable providers have increased their penetration of various services in\\nour markets. We expect that competition will remain robust. Our revenue and cash flow will be adversely\\nimpacted if we cannot reverse our customer losses or continue to provide high-quality services.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe cannot predict which of the many possible future technologies, products\\nor services will be important in order to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be\\nrequired to develop and provide these technologies, products or services. Our ability to compete successfully\\nwill depend on the effectiveness of capital expenditure\\ninvestments in our properties, our marketing efforts, our ability to anticipate and respond to various\\ncompetitive factors affecting the industry, including a changing regulatory environment that may affect our\\nbusiness and that of our competitors differently, new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer\\npreferences, or habits, demographic trends, economic\\nconditions and pricing strategies by competitors. Increasing competition may\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nreduce our revenues and increase our marketing and other costs as well as\\nrequire us to increase our capital expenditures and thereby decrease our cash\\nflows.\\n\\ufeff\\nSome of our competitors have superior resources, which may place us\\nat a disadvantage.\\n\\ufeff\\nSome of our competitors have market presence, engineering, technical,\\nmarketing and financial capabilities, substantially greater than ours. In addition, some of these competitors\\nare able to raise capital at a lower cost than we are able to. Consequently, some of these competitors may be\\nable to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly, adapt more swiftly to\\nnew or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, take advantage of acquisition and other\\nopportunities more readily and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and\\nservices than we will be able to. Additionally, the greater brand name recognition of some competitors may\\nrequire us to price our services at lower levels in order to retain or obtain customers. Finally, the cost\\nadvantages and greater financial resources of some of these\\ncompetitors may give them the ability to reduce their prices for an extended period of time if they so choose.\\nOur business and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted if we are not able to effectively\\ncompete.\\n\\ufeff\\nWeak economic conditions may decrease demand for our services or necessitate increased\\ndiscounts.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe could be adversely impacted by weak economic conditions or their effects.\\nDownturns in the economy and competition in our markets have in the past, and could\\nin the future, cause some of our customers to reduce or eliminate their purchases of\\nour basic and enhanced voice services, broadband and video services and make it difficult for us to obtain new\\ncustomers or retain existing customers. In addition, if economic conditions are depressed or further\\ndeteriorate, our customers may delay or discontinue payment for our services or seek more competitive pricing\\nfrom other service providers, or we may be required to offer increased discounts in order to retain our\\ncustomers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of\\noperations.\\n\\ufeff\\nDisruption in our networks, infrastructure and information technology may cause us to lose\\ncustomers and/or incur additional expenses.\\n\\ufeff\\nTo attract and retain customers, we must provide reliable service. Some of\\nthe risks to our networks, infrastructure and information technology include physical damage, security\\nbreaches, capacity limitations, power surges or outages, software defects and other disruptions beyond our\\ncontrol, such as natural disasters and acts of terrorism. From time to time in the ordinary course of business,\\nwe experience disruptions in our service due to factors such as cable damage, theft of our equipment, inclement\\nweather and service failures of our third-party service providers. We could experience more significant\\ndisruptions in the future. We could also face disruptions due to capacity limitations if changes in our\\ncustomers\\' usage patterns for our broadband services result in a significant increase\\nin capacity utilization, such as through increased usage of video or peer-to-peer file sharing applications. We\\ncould also face disruptions in our networks if third-party providers elect not to continue doing business with\\nus or put their services up for auction and we are not able to retain their services as a result. Disruptions\\nmay cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose\\ncustomers, or increase our operating expense, all of which could adversely affect our business, revenues and\\ncash flows.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur business is sensitive to the creditworthiness of our wholesale customers.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have substantial business relationships with other communications carriers for which we\\nprovide service. While bankruptcies or insolvency of these carriers have not had a material adverse effect on\\nour business in recent years, future bankruptcies or insolvencies in the industry could result in the loss of\\nsignificant customers, as well as cause more price competition and an increased allowance for doubtful accounts\\nreceivable. Such bankruptcies and insolvencies may be more likely in the future if economic conditions\\nstagnate. As a result, our revenues and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\\n\\ufeff\\nA significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions.\\n\\ufeff\\nAs of December 31, 2017, we\\nhad approximately 22,700 employees. Approximately 16,000 of our total employees were represented by unions and were subject to collective bargaining agreements.\\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately\\n1,400 employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expired in\\n2017, but have been extended and are still effective for\\n2018. Of the union-represented employees as of December 31,\\n2017, approximately\\n4,300, or 27%, of\\nthe unionized workforce are covered by collective agreements that expire in\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n2018 and approximately 7,600, or 48%, of the unionized workforce are covered by\\ncollective bargaining agreements that expire in 2019.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe cannot predict the outcome of negotiations of the collective bargaining\\nagreements covering our employees. If we are unable to\\nreach new agreements or renew existing agreements, employees subject to collective bargaining agreements may\\nengage in strikes, work slowdowns or other labor actions, which could materially disrupt our ability to provide\\nservices. New labor agreements or the renewal of existing agreements may impose significant new costs on us,\\nwhich could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the\\nfuture.\\n\\ufeff\\nIf we are unable to hire or retain key personnel, we may be unable to\\noperate our business successfully.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur success will depend in part upon the continued services of our\\nmanagement. We cannot guarantee that our key personnel will not leave or compete with us. The loss, incapacity\\nor unavailability for any reason of key members of our management team could have a material impact on our\\nbusiness. In addition, our financial results and our ability to compete will suffer if we are unable to\\nattract or retain other qualified personnel in the\\nfuture.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn recent years, we have completed multiple acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be\\nable to realize the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies from such\\nacquisitions or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our\\nbalance sheet. We recorded goodwill impairments in 2017 and if our goodwill or other intangible assets become further impaired, we may be required to record additional non-cash charges\\na non-cash charge to earnings and reduce our stockholders\\' equity.\\n\\ufeff\\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, intangible assets are\\nreviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that\\ntheir carrying value may not be recoverable. Frontier monitors relevant circumstances, including general\\neconomic conditions, enterprise value EBITDA multiples for other providers of communications services, our\\noverall financial performance, and the market prices for our stock, and the potential impact that changes in\\nsuch circumstances might have on the valuation of Frontier\\'s goodwill or other intangible assets.\\nAs a result of the continued decline in the share price of our common stock in each of the\\nfour quarters in 2017, we tested goodwill for impairment. Our second and fourth quarter quantitative\\nassessments indicated that the carrying value of the enterprise exceeded its fair value and, therefore, an\\nimpairment existed. We recorded goodwill impairments totaling $2,748 million for 2017.If our goodwill or other intangible assets are determined to be further\\nimpaired in the future, we may be required to record a non-cash charge to earnings during the\\nperiod in which the impairment is determined, which would reduce our stockholders\\' equity.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe may complete a future significant strategic transaction that may not achieve intended\\nresults or could increase the number of our outstanding shares or amount of outstanding debt.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe continuously evaluate and may in the future enter into\\nadditional strategic transactions. Any such transaction\\ncould happen at any time, could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including, for\\nexample, an acquisition, merger or a sale of certain of our\\nassets.\\n\\ufeff\\nEvaluating potential transactions and integrating completed ones may divert\\nthe attention of our management from ordinary operating matters. The success of these potential transactions\\nwill depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies through\\nthe successful integration of the businesses we acquire with our existing business. Even if we are successful\\nin integrating acquired businesses, we cannot assure you that these integrations will result in the realization\\nof the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies or that these benefits will be\\nrealized within the expected time frames. In addition,\\nacquired businesses may have unanticipated liabilities or contingencies.\\n\\ufeff\\nIf we complete an acquisition, investment or other strategic transaction, we\\nmay require additional financing that could result in an increase in the number of our outstanding shares of\\nstock or the aggregate amount and/or cost of our debt, which may result in an adverse\\nimpact to our ratings. The number of shares of our stock or the\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\naggregate principal amount of our debt that we may\\nissue may be significant. Moreover, the terms of any debt financing may be expensive\\nor adversely impact our results of operations.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have in the past and may in the future consider disposing of certain assets or asset groups.\\nWe may not be able to dispose of such assets on terms that are attractive to us, or at all. To the extent we\\nconsummate such a transaction, we may experience operational challenges in segregating such assets.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn the past, we have disposed of assets for a variety of reasons, and we may, from time to\\ntime, consider disposing of other assets or asset groups in the future. We may not be able to dispose of any\\nsuch assets on terms that are attractive to us, or at all, which could adversely impact our financial condition\\nor results of operation. In addition, to the extent we consummate an agreement for the sale and disposition of\\nan asset or asset group, we may experience operational difficulties segregating them from our retained assets\\nand operations, which could impact the execution or timing for such dispositions and could result in\\ndisruptions to our operations and/or claims for damages, among other things.\\n\\ufeff\\nNegotiations with the providers of content for our video systems may not be successful,\\npotentially resulting in our inability to carry certain programming channels on our FiOS and Vantage video\\nsystems, which could result in the loss of subscribers. Alternatively, because of the power of some content\\nproviders, we may be forced to pay an increasing amount for some content, resulting in higher expenses and\\nlower profitability.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe must negotiate with the content owners of the programming that we carry\\non our multichannel video systems (marketed as FiOS video and Vantage video). These content owners are the\\nexclusive provider of the channels they offer. If we are unable to reach a mutually-agreed contract with a\\ncontent owner, including pricing and carriage provisions, our existing agreements to carry this content may not\\nbe renewed, resulting in the blackout of these channels. The loss of content could result in our loss of\\ncustomers who place a high value on the particular content that is lost. In addition, many content providers\\nown multiple channels. As a result, we typically have to negotiate the pricing for multiple channels rather\\nthan one, and carry and pay for content that customers do not value, in order to have access to other content\\nthat customers do value. Some of our competitors have materially larger scale than we\\ndo, and may, as a result, be better positioned than we are in such negotiations. As a result of these factors,\\nthe expense of content acquisition may continue to increase, and this could result in higher expenses and lower\\nprofitability.\\n\\ufeff\\nRisks Related to Liquidity, Financial Resources and Capitalization\\n\\ufeff\\nWe currently have a significant amount of indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, and are\\ncontractually permitted to incur substantial additional indebtedness and grant substantial additional liens in\\nthe future. Such debt and debt service obligations may adversely affect us.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which amounted to $17.9 billion outstanding at\\nDecember 31, 2017, of which $3.6 billion was secured. We also have access to a $850 million secured Revolving\\nCredit Facility, which currently is undrawn.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe terms of our indentures and credit facilities allow us to incur substantial additional\\nindebtedness and grant substantial additional liens in the future. In addition, these terms do not prevent us\\nor our restricted subsidiaries from incurring various types of obligations that do not constitute\\n\"indebtedness\" under these terms.\\n\\ufeff\\nIf we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with our senior notes and\\ndebentures, the holders of that new debt will be entitled to share ratably with holders of our senior notes and\\ndebentures in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization,\\ndissolution or other winding up of Frontier. If any such additional indebtedness is secured, it will be\\neffectively senior to our unsecured senior notes and debentures to the extent of the collateral securing such\\nindebtedness. This may have the effect of reducing the probability of payment, or the amount of proceeds paid,\\nto holders of our senior notes and debentures.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn addition, to the extent other new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\\' current debt\\nlevels, the substantial leverage risks described below would increase.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nThe potential significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of\\noperations that could result from our substantial debt include:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlimitations on our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms or\\nat all;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninstances in which we are unable to comply with the covenants contained in our indentures and\\ncredit agreements or to generate cash sufficient to make required debt payments, which circumstances have the\\npotential of accelerating the maturity of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe possibility that we may trigger the springing maturity provisions in our credit\\nagreements;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe allocation of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt,\\nthus reducing the amount of our cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and\\ndividends that would otherwise improve our competitive position, results of operations or stock price;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrequiring us to issue debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on\\nunfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncompromising our flexibility to plan for, or react to, competitive challenges in our business\\nand the telecommunications industry; and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe possibility of our being put at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who, relative\\nto their size, do not have as much debt as we do, and competitors who may be in a more favorable position to\\naccess additional capital resources.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nIn addition, our senior notes and debentures are rated below \"investment grade\" by independent\\nrating agencies. This has resulted in higher borrowing costs for us. We cannot assure that these rating\\nagencies will not lower our debt ratings further, if in the rating agencies\\' judgment such an action is\\nappropriate. A further lowering of a rating would likely increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our\\naccess to capital. Our negotiations with vendors, customers and business partners can be negatively impacted if\\nthey deem us a credit risk as a result of our credit rating.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe indentures and agreements governing our debt, including our senior notes and debentures and\\nour credit facilities, contain covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries that\\nmay affect our ability to operate our business, make payments on our debt, and pay dividends.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe indentures and agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain covenants that, among\\nother things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nincur additional indebtedness, guarantee indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncreate liens;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nenter into mergers or consolidations, or transfer or sell all or substantially all of our\\nassets;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npay dividends on, or make distributions in respect of, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock,\\nmake certain investments or make other restricted payments;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmake certain asset sales;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nenter into agreements that might prevent certain of our subsidiaries from making distributions,\\nloans or advances to us or other subsidiaries; and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nengage in transactions with affiliates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nIn addition, our credit facilities require us to comply with additional covenants, including\\nfinancial ratios. Any future indebtedness may also require us to comply with similar or other covenants. These\\nrestrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things,\\nlimiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate\\nopportunities.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply\\nwith these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing\\nindentures and agreements could result in a default under those documents and under other agreements containing\\ncross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt and to\\nforeclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds\\nor other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by indentures and\\ncredit agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair\\nour ability to obtain other financing.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier is primarily a holding company and, as a result, we rely on the receipt of funds from\\nour subsidiaries in order to meet our cash needs and service our indebtedness, including our senior notes and\\ndebentures.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier is primarily a holding company and its principal assets consist of the shares of\\ncapital stock or other equity instruments of its subsidiaries. As a holding company, we depend on dividends,\\ndistributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, including those arising under\\nour senior notes and debentures, and meet our cash needs. We cannot assure you that the operating results of\\nour subsidiaries at any given time will be sufficient to make dividends, distributions or other payments to us\\nin order to allow us to make payments on our indebtedness, including our senior notes and debentures. In\\naddition, the payment of these dividends, distributions and other payments, as well as other transfers of\\nassets, between our subsidiaries and from our subsidiaries to us may be subject to legal, regulatory or\\ncontractual restrictions. Some state regulators have imposed and others may consider imposing on regulated\\ncompanies, including us, cash management practices that could limit the ability of such regulated companies to\\ntransfer cash between subsidiaries or to the parent company. While none of the existing state regulations\\nmaterially affects our cash management, any changes to the existing regulations or imposition of new\\nregulations or restrictions may materially adversely affect our ability to transfer cash within our\\nconsolidated companies.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur senior notes and debentures are structurally subordinated to liabilities of our\\nsubsidiaries.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur subsidiaries have not guaranteed our senior notes and debentures. As a\\nresult, holders of such securities will not have any claim as a creditor against our subsidiaries. Accordingly,\\nall obligations of our subsidiaries (including any liens granted by our subsidiaries on any of their assets to\\nsecure any of our obligations) will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be\\navailable for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise. In addition, our subsidiaries may be able to incur\\n$1.4 billion of additional debt (including secured debt),\\nsubject to the contractual limitations in our debt instruments applicable to such subsidiaries. Holders or our\\nsenior notes and debentures would be structurally subordinated to any such future debt as well.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur senior notes and debentures are unsecured and subordinated to any secured indebtedness.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur senior notes and debentures are unsecured and therefore are subordinated to our existing\\nand future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. At\\nDecember 31, 2017, our secured indebtedness consisted of obligations under the JPM Credit Agreement, the CoBank\\nCredit Agreements, the Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Loan B and the Continuing Agreement for Standby Letters\\nof Credit between Frontier and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi UFJ, LTD, each\\nof which is secured by the security package under the JPM Credit Agreement which includes pledges of the equity\\ninterests in certain Frontier subsidiaries and guaranties by certain Frontier subsidiaries. In the event of a\\nbankruptcy or similar proceeding, the assets that serve as collateral for our secured indebtedness will be\\navailable to satisfy the obligations under the secured indebtedness before any payments are made on the senior\\nnotes and debentures from the proceeds of such assets. The indentures governing our senior notes and debentures\\npermit us, subject to specified limitations, to incur a substantial amount of additional secured debt.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt\\nservice obligations to increase.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nAt December 31, 2017, approximately 20% of our total debt is subject to variable rates of\\ninterest. Borrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest\\nrate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness\\nwould increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including\\ncash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. In the future, we may enter into\\ninterest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce\\ninterest rate volatility. However, we might not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our\\nvariable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into might not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe may not have sufficient funds to repurchase our senior notes upon a change of control\\ntriggering event.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe terms of our senior notes require us to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon the\\noccurrence of a Change of Control and Ratings Decline (as defined in the indentures governing the notes) at a\\npurchase price equal to 101% of the respective principal amounts of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest\\nto, but not including, the date of the purchase. It is possible that we would not have sufficient funds at the\\ntime of such a change of control triggering event to make the required repurchase of the applicable series of\\nnotes and would be required to obtain third party financing to do so. We may not be able to obtain this\\nfinancing on commercially reasonable terms, or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the\\noccurrence of certain change of control events may constitute an event of default under the terms of our credit\\nfacilities. Such an event of default would entitle the lenders under our credit facilities to, among other\\nthings, cause all outstanding debt thereunder to become due and payable.\\n\\ufeff\\nAny future payment of dividends on our capital stock will be at the sole discretion of our\\nBoard of Directors and subject to certain important limitations, including legal and contractual\\nrestrictions.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe amount and timing of future dividend payments, if any, on our common stock and Series A\\nPreferred Stock will be made at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors based on factors such as cash\\nflow and cash requirements, capital expenditures requirements, financial condition, covenants in our debt\\ninstruments and legal restrictions. Under Delaware law, our Board of Directors may only declare and pay\\ndividends on shares of our capital stock out of our statutory \"surplus\" (which is the amount equal to total\\nassets minus total liabilities, in each case at fair market value, minus statutory capital), or if there is no\\nsuch surplus, out of our net profits for the then current or immediately preceding fiscal year. In addition,\\nour ability to declare and pay dividends is restricted by our existing financing arrangements and may be\\nrestricted by future financing arrangements. For example, our credit agreements prohibit us from using proceeds\\nfrom our revolving credit facility to fund dividend payments if the undrawn amount under the revolver is less\\nthan $250 million, and we may not pay dividends on our common stock in excess of $2.40 per share in any fiscal\\nyear. As such, there can be no assurances that we will declare and pay any future dividends on our capital\\nstock.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe expect to make contributions to our pension plan in future years, the\\namount of which will be impacted by volatility in asset values related to Frontier\\'s\\npension plan and/or changes in pension plan assumptions.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier made contributions of $75 million, net of the Differential payment received (See note\\n17), and $28 million to its pension plan in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and we expect to continue to make\\ncontributions in future years. Volatility in our asset values, liability calculations, or returns may impact\\nthe costs of maintaining our pension plan and our future funding requirements. Any future material contribution\\ncould have a negative impact on our liquidity by reducing cash flows.\\n\\ufeff\\nSignificant changes in discount rates, rates of return on pension assets, mortality tables and\\nother factors could adversely affect our earnings and equity and increase our pension funding requirements.\\n\\ufeff\\nPension costs and obligations are determined using actual results as well as actuarial\\nvaluations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the long-term\\nexpected return on assets and mortality tables. Other assumptions include salary increases and retirement age.\\nSome of these\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nassumptions, such as the discount rate and return on pension assets, are reflective of economic\\nconditions and largely out of our control. Changes in the pension assumptions could adversely affect our\\nearnings, equity and funding requirements.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\nRisks Related to Regulation and Oversight\\n\\ufeff\\nChanges in federal or\\nstate regulations may reduce the switched access charge revenues we receive.\\n\\ufeff\\nA portion of Frontier\\'s total revenues ($165 million, or 2%, in 2017 and\\n$170 million, or 2%, in 2016) are derived from switched access charges paid by other carriers for services\\nwe provide in originating intrastate and interstate\\nlong-distance traffic. Frontier expects a portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from switched\\naccess charges paid by these carriers for these services. The rates Frontier can charge for switched access are\\nregulated by the FCC and state regulatory\\nagencies.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn 2011, the FCC adopted the 2011 Order regarding Intercarrier Compensation, which is the\\npayment framework that governs how carriers compensate each other for the exchange of voice traffic between\\ncarriers. The 2011 Order began a multi-year transition that moves the rate for terminating traffic to near zero\\nby 2017, with the final phase down of a subset of traffic in 2018. Additionally, the 2011 Order requires VoIP\\nproviders to pay interstate terminating interconnection charges and requires all carriers terminating traffic\\nto provide appropriate call information, thus prohibiting so-called \"phantom traffic.\" The FCC also reformed\\nthe Universal Service Fund in this order to shift the High-Cost portion of the fund from supporting voice\\nservices to supporting broadband deployment in high-cost areas.\\n\\ufeff\\nHowever, the 2011 Order did not resolve all questions on Intercarrier Compensation. The FCC\\ncontinues to consider the possibility of transitioning originating access rates in the future. We cannot\\npredict when or how the FCC would implement any changes originating access rates, and future reductions in\\nthese revenues may directly affect our profitability and cash flows as these regulatory revenues do not have an\\nequal level of associated variable expenses.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn August 2017, the FCC decision to deregulate the\\nmarket for special access services where the market is determined to be competitive and the transport market\\nnationwide became effective. Some aspects of that decision are under appeal by stakeholders.\\nWe cannot predict the outcome of that appeal or the impact of\\nfuture changes on our results or operations.\\n\\ufeff\\nCertain states also have their own open proceedings to address reform to originating intrastate\\naccess charges, other intercarrier compensation, and state universal service funds. Although the FCC has\\npre-empted state jurisdiction on most access charges, many states could consider moving forward with their\\nproceedings. We cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or\\nswitched access revenues. However, future reductions in our subsidy or switched access revenues may directly\\naffect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have an equal level of associated\\nvariable expenses.\\n\\ufeff\\nA portion of Frontier\\'s revenues are derived from federal and state subsidies. To the extent\\nthe federal or any state government reduces such subsidies, our operating income could be materially and\\nadversely impacted.\\n\\ufeff\\nA portion of Frontier\\'s total revenues ($395 million, or 4%, in 2017 and $409 million, or 5%,\\nin 2016) are derived from federal and state subsidies for rural and high-cost support, that consists of CAF II\\nsupport, Federal High Cost support, and various state subsidies. The FCC\\'s 2011 Order changed how federal\\nsubsidies are calculated and disbursed. These changes transitioned the USF (Universal Service Fund), which\\nsupported voice services in high-cost areas, to the CAF (Connect America Fund), which supports broadband\\ndeployment in high-cost areas. Federal subsidies represented approximately 92% of subsidy revenue in 2017 and\\n89% in 2016, with the remainder being state subsidies.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier is required to contribute to the Universal Service Fund. The FCC allows Frontier to\\nrecover these contributions through a USF Surcharge on customers\\' bills. This surcharge accounted for $216\\nmillion of revenue in 2017 and $217 million in 2016.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nFuture reductions in these subsidies, or in our ability to recover Universal Service Fund\\ncontributions, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier and our industry will likely remain highly regulated, and we could incur substantial\\ncompliance costs that could constrain our ability to compete in our target markets.\\n\\ufeff\\nAs an incumbent local exchange carrier, some of the services we offer are subject to\\nsignificant regulation from federal, state and local authorities. This regulation could impact our ability to\\nchange our rates, especially on our basic voice services and our access rates, and could impose substantial\\ncompliance costs on us. In some jurisdictions, regulation may restrict our ability to expand our service\\nofferings. In addition, changes to the regulations that govern our business (including any implementation of\\nthe 2011 Order) may have an adverse effect on our business by reducing the allowable fees that we may charge,\\nimposing additional compliance costs, reducing the amount of subsidies or otherwise changing the nature of our\\noperations and the competition in our industry. At this time, it is unknown how these regulations will affect\\nFrontier\\'s operations or ability to compete in the future.\\n\\ufeff\\nOther FCC rulemakings and state regulatory proceedings, including those relating to\\nintercarrier compensation, universal service and broadband services, could have a substantial adverse impact on\\nour operations.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn December 2017, the FCC voted to roll back the FCC\\'s 2015 Order applying the Title II\\nframework to broadband services. This decision restores the light touch regulatory treatment of broadband\\nservice in place prior to 2015 and preserves the FCC\\'s transparency requirements. The decision also clarifies\\nthat the Federal Trade Commission is the proper venue for enforcement of the transparency requirements and\\nprivacy practices. Several parties are expected to appeal this order and may seek a stay of its provisions.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur Internet access offerings could become subject to additional laws and regulations as they\\nare adopted or applied to the Internet. As the significance of the Internet expands, federal, state and local\\ngovernments may pass laws and adopt rules and regulations, including those directed at privacy, or apply\\nexisting laws and regulations to the Internet (including Internet access services), and related matters are\\nunder consideration in both federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies. Although the FCC has\\npre-empted state jurisdiction on network neutrality and privacy, many states could consider moving forward with\\nlegislation on these or other Internet-related issues. At least two states, Montana and New York have already\\ntaken executive action directed at reinstating aspects of the FCC\\'s 2015 Order. We cannot predict whether the\\noutcome of expected or pending challenges to the FCC\\'s order or future proceedings will prove beneficial or\\ndetrimental to our competitive position.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe are subject to the oversight of certain federal and state agencies that have in the past,\\nand may in the future, investigate or pursue enforcement actions against us relating to consumer protection\\nmatters.\\n\\ufeff\\nCertain federal and state agencies, including state attorneys general, monitor and exercise\\noversight related to consumer protection matters, including those affecting the communications industry. Such\\nagencies have in the past, and may in the future, choose to launch an inquiry or investigation of our business\\npractices in response to customer complaints or other publicized customer service issues or disruptions. Such\\ninquiries or investigations could result in reputational harm, enforcement actions, litigation, fines,\\nsettlements and/or operational and financial conditions being placed on the company, any of which could\\nmaterially and adversely affect our business.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nTax legislation may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\\n\\ufeff\\nTax laws are dynamic and continually change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of\\nthe law are issued or applied. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation\\ncommonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA). The TCJA makes broad and complex changes to the\\nU.S. tax code and, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant\\nadditional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and\\nimposes limitations on the use of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31,\\n2017. The reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate results in a decreased valuation of our deferred tax asset\\nand liabilities. The overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial\\ncondition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will\\nconform to the newly enacted federal tax law. The determination of the benefit from (provision for) income\\ntaxes requires complex estimations, significant judgments and significant knowledge and experience concerning\\nthe applicable tax laws. Given that we are still in the transition period for the accounting for income tax\\neffects of the TCJA, the current assessment on deferred tax assets (liabilities) is based on the currently\\navailable information and guidance. If in the future any element of the tax reform changes the related\\naccounting guidance for income tax, it could affect our income tax position and we may need to adjust the\\nbenefit from (provision for) income taxes accordingly.\\n\\ufeff\\nRisks Related to Technology\\n\\ufeff\\nWe may be unable to meet the technological needs or expectations of our customers, and may lose\\ncustomers as a result.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to significant changes in technology, and replacing\\nor upgrading our infrastructure to keep pace with such technological changes could result in significant\\ncapital expenditures. If we do not replace or upgrade technology and equipment and manage broadband speeds and\\ncapacity as necessary, we may be unable to compete effectively because we will not be able to meet the needs or\\nexpectations of our customers.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn addition, enhancements to product offerings may influence our customers to consider other\\nservice providers, such as cable operators or wireless providers. We may be unable to attract new or retain\\nexisting customers from cable companies due to their deployment of enhanced broadband and VoIP technology. In\\naddition, new capacity services for wireless broadband technologies may permit our competitors to offer\\nbroadband data services to our customers throughout most or all of our service areas. Any resulting inability\\nto attract new or retain existing customers could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a\\nmaterial manner.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe rely on network and information systems and other technology, and a disruption or failure of\\nsuch networks, systems or technology as a result of computer viruses, cyber-attacks, misappropriation of data\\nor other malfeasance, as well as outages, accidental releases of information or similar events, may disrupt our\\nbusiness and materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe maintain security measures, disaster recovery plans and business continuity plans for our\\nbusiness and are continuously working to upgrade our existing technology systems and provide employee training\\naround the cyber risks we face. Nevertheless, our information technology networks and infrastructure may be\\nsubject to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, cyber-attacks or breaches, employee or\\nthird-party error or malfeasance, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures,\\nnatural disasters or other catastrophic events.\\n\\ufeff\\nFurther, our network and information systems are subject to various risks\\nrelated to third parties and other parties we may not fully control. We use encryption and authentication\\ntechnology licensed from third parties to provide secure transmission of confidential information, including\\nour business data and customer information. Similarly, we rely on employees in our network operations centers,\\ndata centers, call centers and retail stores to follow our procedures when handling sensitive information.\\nWhile we select our third-party business partners and employees carefully, we do not always control their\\nactions, which could expose us to cyber-security risks. In addition, our customers\\nusing our network to access the Internet may become victim to malicious and abusive Internet activities, such\\nas unsolicited mass advertising (or spam), peer-to-peer file sharing, distribution of viruses, worms and other\\ndestructive or disruptive software; these activities could adversely affect our network, result in excessive\\ncall volume at our call centers and damage our or our customers\\' equipment and data.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nAny unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional release\\nof confidential information or other disruptions could result in misappropriation of our or our customers\\'\\nsensitive information; reputational harm; increased costs, such as those relating to remediation or future\\nprotection; customer dissatisfaction, which could lead to a decline in customers and revenue; and legal claims\\nor proceedings, fines and other liabilities. There can be no assurance that the impact of such incidents would\\nnot be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nItem 1B.

Market for\\nRegistrant\\'s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\\n\\ufeff\\nOur common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under\\nthe symbol FTR. The amount and timing of dividends payable on our common stock are within the sole discretion\\nof our Board of Directors. Dividends on shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are payable on a cumulative\\nbasis when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors (or an authorized committee thereof) at an annual rate\\nof 11.125% on the liquidation preference of $100.00 per share, on the last business day of March, June,\\nSeptember and December of each year, up to the mandatory conversion date of June 29,\\n2018. Series A Preferred Stock dividends of $214\\nmillion were paid in each of 2017 and 2016. Cash dividends paid to common\\nshareholders were $266 million and $493 million in\\n2017 and 2016, respectively. The declaration and payment of future dividends on our common\\nstock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon many factors, including our\\nfinancial condition, results of operations, growth prospects, funding requirements, payment of cumulative\\ndividends on Series A Preferred Stock, applicable law, restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness\\nand other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.\\n\\ufeff\\nA portion of the dividends on common stock may\\nbe classified as total ordinary dividends and represents qualified dividends, and a\\nportion of the dividends is classified as non-dividend distributions and represents a return of capital.

Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\nIntroduction\\n\\ufeff\\n(a) Results of Operations\\n\\ufeff\\n2017 Compared to 2016\\n\\ufeff\\nOn April 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Verizon\\'s wireline\\nproperties in California, Texas, and Florida (the CTF Acquisition, of the CTF Operations). Frontier\\'s scope of operations and balance sheet changed materially as a result of the completion of the\\nCTF Acquisition. Historical financial and operating data presented for Frontier includes the results of the CTF\\nOperations that were acquired in the CTF Acquisition from the date of acquisition on April 1,\\n2016. As a result our financial results for 2017 include CTF\\nOperations for the full year of 2017, while financial results for 2016 only included CTF Operations for the\\nfinal nine months of 2016.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn July 10, 2017, we effected a one for fifteen reverse stock split of our common stock. The\\nreverse stock split reduced the number of common shares issued (which includes outstanding shares and treasury\\nshares) from approximately 1,193,000,000 shares to 80,000,000 shares, and reduced shares outstanding from\\n1,178,000,000 shares to 79,000,000 shares. In addition, and at the same time, the total number of shares of\\ncommon stock that Frontier is authorized to issue changed from 1,750,000,000 shares to 175,000,000 shares.\\nThere was no change in the par value of the common stock, and no fractional shares were issued. All share and\\nper share amounts in the financial discussion below have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented\\nto give effect to the reverse stock split. As a result of our reverse stock split the conversion rates of our\\nSeries A Preferred Stock were proportionately adjusted.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\nThe sections below include tables that present customer counts, average\\nmonthly consumer revenue per customer (ARPC) and consumer customer churn.\\nWe define churn as the number of\\nconsumer customer deactivations during the month divided by\\nthe number of consumer customers at the beginning of the month and utilize the average\\nof each monthly churn in the period.\\n\\ufeff\\nManagement believes that consumer customer counts and average monthly revenue per customer are\\nimportant factors in evaluating our consumer customer trends. Among the key services we provide to consumer\\ncustomers are voice service, data service and video service. We continue to explore the potential to provide\\nadditional services to our customer base, with the objective of meeting all of our customers\\' communications\\nneeds.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following should be read in conjunction with Item 7. \"Management\\'s\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included in our Annual Report on Form\\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs of or for the year ended\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDecember 31, 2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n% Increase (Decrease)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomers (in thousands)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4,850\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5,393\\n\\n\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConsumer customer metrics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomers (in thousands)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4,397\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4,891\\n\\n\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNet customer additions/(losses)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(494)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,767\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n(128)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage monthly consumer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrevenue per customer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n80.96\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n77.47\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomer monthly churn\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.17%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.98%\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommercial customer metrics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomers (in thousands)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n453\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n502\\n\\n\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBroadband subscriber metrics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(in thousands)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBroadband subscribers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3,938\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4,271\\n\\n\\n\\n(8)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNet subscriber additions/(losses)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(333)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,809\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n(118)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVideo (excl.

As of December 31, 2017, 67% of our consumer broadband customers were subscribed to at least one other service offering.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe had approximately 4.4 million and 4.9 million total consumer customers as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our\\naverage monthly consumer customer churn was 2.17% for the year ended December 31, 2017 (1.91% for Frontier legacy and 2.56% for CTF Operations) compared to 1.98%\\n(1.76% for Frontier legacy and 2.46% for CTF Operations) for 2016. The consolidated\\naverage monthly consumer revenue per customer (consumer ARPC) increased by $3.49 or 5% to $80.96 during 2017\\ncompared to the prior year. The overall increase in consumer ARPC is a result of the increased revenue provided\\nby a full year of CTF operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016. This\\nincrease was partially offset by a decrease in video services.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe had approximately 453,000 and 502,000 total commercial customers as of\\nDecember 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We lost approximately 49,000 commercial customers during the year\\nended December 31, 2017 compared to an increase of 213,000 customers for the prior year. Frontier expects the\\ndeclines in voice services revenue and wireless backhaul revenues from commercial customers to continue in\\n2018. Our Ethernet product revenues from our SME (small business, medium business and\\nlarger enterprise customers) and carrier customers grew 11% for the Frontier legacy operations during 2017, compared to the prior year\\nperiod. The prior year increase in customers was driven by 250,000 new customers\\nacquired from Verizon in the CTF Acquisition.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe had approximately 3.9 million and 4.3 million\\nbroadband subscribers as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017,\\nwe lost approximately 333,000 net broadband subscribers\\ncompared to an increase of 1,809,000 for the prior year. The prior year increase\\nin subscribers was driven by 2,052,000 new subscribers acquired from Verizon in the CTF Acquisition.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe offer video services to certain of our customers under the\\nFiOS® brand in portions of California, Texas,\\nFlorida, Indiana, Oregon, and Washington, and under the\\nVantage brand in portions of Connecticut, North Carolina, South Carolina,\\nMinnesota, Illinois, New York, and Ohio.

This increase was partially offset by\\ndecreased voice and data and Internet services revenues driven by a decline in\\ncustomers.\\n\\ufeff\\nConsolidated customer revenue increased $93 million due to consumer customer\\nrevenue and $160 million due to commercial customer revenues. The increase in consumer customer revenue was\\nprimarily due additional revenue provided by a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months\\nin 2016. This increase was partially offset by decreases in voice, data and internet,\\nand video services revenue. We have experienced declines in\\nthe number of traditional voice customers and switched access minutes of use as a result of competition and the\\navailability of substitutes, a trend we expect to continue. The increase in consolidated commercial customer revenue was primarily driven by additional revenue provided\\nby a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016. This increase was partially\\noffset by decreases in our voice services revenue and nonswitched revenue including\\nwireless backhaul revenue and decreased revenues related to our Frontier Secure Strategic\\nPartnerships business which was sold in May 2017.\\n\\ufeff\\nConsolidated switched access and subsidy revenue represented\\n9% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. Switched\\naccess revenue was $165 million for the year ended December\\n31, 2017, or 2% of our revenues, which decreased from\\n$170 million, or 2% of our revenues, in the prior year period. The decrease was driven by reduced\\nrates which were mandated by the 2011 Order with a related decline in operating\\nexpenses. Subsidy revenue, including CAF Phase II subsidies, was $611 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 7% of our revenues, which decreased from $626\\nmillion, or 7% of our revenues, in the\\nprior year period.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nWe categorize our products, services, and other revenues into the following five\\ncategories:\\n\\ufeff\\nData and Internet Services\\nData and internet services include broadband services for consumer and\\ncommercial customers. We also provide data transmission\\nservices to high volume commercial customers and other carriers with dedicated high capacity circuits\\n(\"nonswitched access\") including services to wireless providers (\"wireless backhaul\").\\n\\ufeff\\nConsolidated data and Internet services revenue for the year ended December\\n31, 2017 increased $169 million as compared with 2016.\\nConsolidated data services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased\\n$81 million, or 4%, to $2,240 million due to the additional revenue\\nprovided by a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016. This increase was\\npartially offset by a reduction in revenue as a result of the sale of the Frontier\\nSecure Strategic Partnerships business in May 2017 and a decrease in the total number of broadband\\nsubscribers. Consolidated nonswitched access revenues for the year ended December 31,\\n2017 increased $88 million, or 6%, to $1,622 million as\\ncompared with 2016 due to additional revenue provided by a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only\\nnine months in 2016. This increase was partially offset by lower monthly recurring\\nrevenue for wireless backhaul and other carrier services. We expect wireless data\\nusage to continue to increase, which may drive the need for additional wireless backhaul capacity. Despite the\\nneed for additional capacity, in the near term, we anticipate that our overall wireless backhaul revenues\\n(which comprise approximately 3% of consolidated total revenues) will continue to decline in 2018, as our\\ncarrier customers migrate to Ethernet solutions at lower price points or migrate to\\nour competitors.\\n\\ufeff\\nVoice Services\\nVoice services include traditional local and long-distance wireline services, data-based Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)\\nservices, as well as voice messaging services offered to our consumer and commercial customers. Voice services\\nalso include the long-distance voice origination and\\ntermination services that we provide to our commercial customers and other carriers.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe decrease of $22\\nmillion in voice services revenue was primarily due to the continued\\nloss of voice customers and decreases in long-distance\\nrevenue among those customers that do not have a bundled long-distance plan, which was partially offset by additional revenues resulting from\\na full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016.\\n\\ufeff\\nVideo Services\\nVideo services include revenues generated from\\nservices provided directly to consumer customers through the FiOS video and Vantage video brands, and through\\nDISH satellite TV services.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe increase of $60 million\\nin video services revenue was primarily due to additional revenue provided by a full\\nyear of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016. The increase was partially offset\\nby reduced revenue resulting from a decrease in the total number of video\\nsubscribers.\\n\\ufeff\\nOther\\nOther customer revenue includes sales of customer premise equipment to our commercial customers\\nand directory services, less our provision for bad debts.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe increase of $46 million in other revenue was\\nprimarily due to a decrease in uncollectibles, which was partially offset by a\\ndecrease in maintenance contracts.\\n\\ufeff\\nSwitched Access and Subsidy\\nSwitched access and subsidy revenues include revenues derived from allowing\\nother carriers to use our network to originate and/or terminate their local and long-distance voice traffic (\"switched access\"). These services are primarily billed\\non a minutes-of-use basis applying tariffed rates filed with the FCC or state agencies. We also receive cost\\nsubsidies from state and federal authorities, including the Connect America Fund.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe decrease of $21 million in switched access and subsidy revenue was primarily due to decreases in subsidies from the state high cost, offset by additional revenue provided by a full year of\\nCTF Operations in 2017 compared to 2016.

Our second and\\nfourth quarter quantitative assessments indicated that the carrying value of the enterprise exceeded its fair\\nvalue and, therefore, an impairment existed. We recorded goodwill impairments totaling $2,748 million for 2017.\\nThe driver for the impairment in the second quarter was a reduction in our profitability and utilized EBITDA\\nestimate, which when applied to our market multiple resulted in a lower enterprise valuation. During the fourth\\nquarter, the impairment was largely driven by a lower enterprise valuation resulting from a reduction in\\nutilized market multiple from 5.8x to 5.5x reflecting the lower outlook for our industry as a whole. The\\nrevaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities which resulted from the enactment of Tax Cut and Job Act,\\ncaused further goodwill impairment. Further declines in our profitability or share\\nprice could result in additional impairment in the future.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the year ended December 31,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$ Increase\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n% Increase\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n($ in millions)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Decrease)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Decrease)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAcquisition and integration costs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n436\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n(411)\\n\\n\\n\\n(94)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nAcquisition costs include financial advisory, accounting, regulatory, legal and other related\\ncosts.

Unless otherwise noted, the variance explanations discussed below\\nare based upon an analysis of the 2016 financial data for Frontier legacy operations (excluding the CTF\\nOperations) in comparison to 2015.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe sections below include tables that present customer counts, average monthly revenue per\\ncustomer (ARPC) and consumer customer churn which we define as the average of the amount of consumer customer\\ndeactivations during the month divided by the number of consumer customers at the beginning of the month. The\\nfollowing also categorizes revenue into customer revenue (consumer and commercial) and regulatory revenue\\n(switched access and subsidy). The decline in the number of customers was partially offset by increased\\npenetration of additional higher revenue generating products and services sold to both consumer and commercial\\ncustomers, which has increased our average monthly revenue per customer in 2016 as compared to 2015. Similar to\\nother wireline providers, we have experienced declines in the number of traditional voice customers, switched\\naccess minutes of use and rates per switched access minute of use, due to the FCC\\'s intercarrier compensation\\nreform, as a result of competition and the availability of substitutes, a trend which we expect will\\ncontinue.\\n\\ufeff\\nManagement believes that consumer customer counts and average monthly revenue per customer are\\nimportant factors in evaluating our consumer customer trends. Among the key services we provide to consumer\\ncustomers are voice service, data service and video service.

As of December 31, 2016,\\n63% of our consumer broadband\\ncustomers were subscribed to at least one other service offering.\\n\\ufeff\\nDuring 2016, we gained approximately 2.0 million customers, net, as compared\\nto a loss of 96,000 customers, net, in 2015. Although we added approximately 2.5 million customers in 2016\\nfollowing the CTF Acquisition, we lost a net of approximately 553,000 customers across all of our markets.\\nThese customer losses were more heavily weighted in the newly acquired CTF markets due to transition\\ndisruptions following the acquisition, resulting in higher than normal customer churn, as well as the\\nsuspension of collection activities prior to and after the closing of the CTF Acquisition, and the suspension\\nof marketing efforts for a period of time following the acquisition. These actions resulted in fewer additions\\nthan would otherwise have been achieved.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe had approximately 4.9 million and 3.1\\nmillion total consumer customers as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively Although we added approximately 2.3 million total consumer customers attributable to the CTF\\nAcquisition in 2016, we lost approximately 516,000 consumer customers, net, during 2016, composed of losses in both our legacy\\nmarkets and in the CTF markets, principally driven by declines in voice customers. Our consumer\\ncustomer monthly churn was 1.98% for 2016.\\nAverage monthly consumer revenue per customer\\n(consumer ARPC) increased $13.54, or\\n21%, to $77.47 during 2016 as compared to 2015. The overall increase in\\nconsumer ARPC is a result of higher video revenue from our CTF\\nOperations and improvements in data services revenue for our legacy operations, partially offset by\\nlower voice services revenue. We expect to improve our video and\\ndata subscriber trends for our Frontier legacy and CTF operations. We anticipate continuing declines in voice\\nservices revenue as fewer consumer customers subscribe to\\nlandline voice services.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe had approximately\\n0.5 million and 0.3 million total commercial customers as of December 31, 2016 and\\n2015, respectively.

Average monthly commercial revenue per customer (commercial ARPC)\\ndecreased $17.16, or 2%, to $673.72 during\\n2016 as compared to 2015. The commercial ARPC decrease is\\nprimarily attributable to our CTF markets having lower ARPC per SME (small business, medium business and larger\\nenterprise customers) customer and proportionally fewer wholesale customers relative to total\\ncommercial customers as compared to our legacy markets.\\nWe have seen modest increases in our revenues from small/medium/enterprise (SME) customers\\nthroughout 2016, and our Ethernet product revenues from our SME and carrier customers has grown by 8% for the\\nFrontier legacy operations during 2016.\\n\\ufeff\\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1.8 million more broadband\\nsubscribers than we did at December 31, 2015. We added 2,052,000 subscribers as part of the CTF Acquisition;\\nhowever, we lost approximately 243,000 net subscribers, primarily due to fewer gross activations and higher\\ncustomer churn. At December 31, 2016, 57% of our consolidated consumer broadband customers subscribed to speeds in excess of our 6 Mbps basic speed tier, up from 29% at December 31,\\n2015.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe offer video services under the Vantage brand to our customers in\\nConnecticut, South Carolina, Minnesota, and Illinois and under the FiOS®\\nbrand in California, Texas, and Florida (and on a limited basis in Indiana, Oregon and\\nWashington).

Similar to other wireline providers, we have experienced declines in the\\nnumber of traditional voice customers and switched access\\nminutes of use as a result of competition and the availability of substitutes, a trend we expect to continue.\\nThe consolidated monthly average revenue per customer (ARPC) for our consumer customers increased 21% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015.

The consolidated ARPC for our commercial\\ncustomers decreased 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared with 2015.\\nThe commercial ARPC decrease is primarily attributable to our\\nCTF markets having lower ARPC per SME (small business, medium business and larger enterprise customers)\\ncustomer and proportionally fewer wholesale customers relative to total business customers as compared to our\\nlegacy markets.\\n\\ufeff\\nConsolidated switched access and subsidy revenue of $797 million represented 9% of our revenues\\nfor 2016. Switched access revenue was $170 million in 2016, or 2% of our revenues, down from $177 million, or\\n3% of our revenues, in 2015. The Report and Order released by the FCC on November 18, 2011 (the 2011 Order)\\nprovided for the gradual elimination of terminating traffic charges by 2017. Switched access revenue declined\\nsequentially in the third quarter of 2016, reflecting the rate reductions mandated by the 2011 Order, and we\\nanticipate that we have experienced nearly all of the rate decline related to the 2011 Order. We have been able\\nto recover a significant portion of these lost revenues through end user rates and other replacement support\\nmechanisms, a trend we expect will continue throughout 2017. We expect declining revenue trends in switched\\naccess revenue to continue in 2017 in our legacy operations. Subsidy revenue, including CAF Phase II subsidies,\\nwas $626 million in 2016, or 7% of our revenues, which increased from $500 million, or 9% of our revenues, in\\n2015.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe categorize our products, services and other revenues among the following five\\ncategories:\\n\\ufeff\\nVoice Services\\nVoice services revenue for 2016 decreased as compared with 2015, primarily due\\nto the continued loss of voice customers and, to a lesser extent, decreases in individual feature packages, as\\nwell as long-distance revenue among those customers that do\\nnot have a bundled long-distance plan, partially offset by\\nincreased local voice charges to consumer and\\ncommercial end users.\\n\\ufeff\\nData and Internet Services\\nData and Internet services revenue for 2016 decreased as compared with 2015. Data services\\nrevenues for 2016 increased $45 million, or 3%, primarily due to higher Frontier Secure revenues. Nonswitched\\naccess revenues decreased $55 million, or 6%, primarily due to lower monthly recurring revenues for wireless\\nbackhaul and other carrier services. We expect wireless data usage to continue to increase, which may drive the\\nneed for additional wireless backhaul capacity.\\n\\ufeff\\nVideo Services\\nVideo services for 2016 decreased primarily due to a decrease in the total number of video\\nsubscribers.\\n\\ufeff\\nOther\\nOther revenues for 2016 decreased primarily due to lower directory services revenue.\\n\\ufeff\\nSwitched Access and Subsidy\\nSwitched access and subsidy revenue for 2016 decreased as compared to 2015.\\nSubsidy revenues decreased $16 million, or 3% in 2016, primarily attributable to\\nthe one-time true-up payments and phasedown support recognized in 2015 in connection\\nwith the CAF Phase II program. Switched access revenue\\ndecreased $39 million, or 22%, in 2016 primarily due to the impact of the decline in minutes of use related to\\naccess line losses and the displacement of minutes of use by wireless and other communications services,\\ncombined with the lower rates enacted by the FCC\\'s intercarrier compensation.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n40\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n2016 OPERATING EXPENSES COMPARED TO 2015\\n\\ufeff\\nNETWORK ACCESS EXPENSE\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrontier Legacy (excluding CTF Operations)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConsolidated\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCTF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$ Increase\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n% Increase\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n($ in millions)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmount\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOperations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmount\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Decrease)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Decrease)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmount\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNetwork access expenses\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,470\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n852\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n618\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n(22)\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n640\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nNetwork access expenses include access charges and other third-party costs directly\\nattributable to connecting customer locations to our network and video content costs.

Our primary source of funds during 2017\\nwas cash generated from operations, restricted and unrestricted cash, and additional\\nborrowings. In 2017, we used cash flow from operations,\\nrestricted cash, and cash on hand to principally fund all of our cash investing and financing\\nactivities, primarily capital expenditures, dividends, and\\ndebt repayments. On April 1, 2016, we used the restricted cash obtained from net proceeds of the September 2015\\nsenior notes offering and June 2015 equity offerings, along with additional borrowings and cash on hand, to\\nfinance the CTF Acquisition.\\n\\ufeff\\nAt December 31, 2017, we had a working capital deficit of $1,185 million, including $656 million of long-term debt\\ndue within one year, as compared to a working capital deficit of $788 million at December 31, 2016.\\nThe decline in working capital is primarily due to an increase in long term debt due within\\none year of $293 million as compared to the prior year related to senior notes reaching maturity during 2018.\\nAlthough we have a working capital deficit as of December 31, 2017, after deducting current debt maturities,\\nthe majority of the balance relates to current advanced billings of $270 million that will be recognized as\\nrevenue over the next twelve months.\\n\\ufeff\\nCash Flows provided by Operating Activities\\n\\ufeff\\nCash flows provided by operating activities increased $174 million, or 10%, to $1,850 million in\\n2017 as compared to 2016.

A number of\\nfactors, including but not limited to, losses of customers, pricing pressure from increased\\ncompetition, lower subsidy and switched access revenues, and the impact of economic\\nconditions may negatively affect our cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2017, we had $656\\nmillion and $804 million of debt maturing in 2018 and 2019, respectively.\\n\\ufeff\\nTerm Loan and Credit Facilities\\nOn February 27, 2017, Frontier entered into a first amended and restated\\ncredit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto,\\npursuant to which Frontier combined its revolving credit agreement, dated as of June 2, 2014, and its term loan\\ncredit agreement, dated as of August 12, 2015. Under the JPM Credit Agreement, as further amended on June 15,\\n2017 by Increase Joinder No.1 (as so amended, the JPM Credit Agreement), Frontier has a $1,625 million senior\\nsecured term loan A facility (the Term Loan A) maturing on March 31, 2021, an $850 million undrawn secured\\nrevolving credit facility maturing on February 27, 2022 (the Revolver), and $1,500 million senior secured term\\nloan B facility (the Term Loan B) maturing on June 15, 2024. The determination of interest rates for each of\\nthe facilities under the JPM Credit Agreement is based on margins over the Base Rate (as defined in the JPM\\nCredit Agreement) or over LIBOR, at the election of Frontier. Interest rate margins on the Term Loan A and\\nRevolver (ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% for Base Rate borrowings and 1.75% to 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings) are\\nsubject to adjustment based on Frontier\\'s Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement). The\\ninterest rate on the Term Loan A as of December 31, 2017 was LIBOR plus 2.75%. Interest rate margins on the\\nTerm Loan B (2.75% for Base Rate borrowings and 3.75% for LIBOR borrowings) are not subject to adjustment.

Letters of credit issued under the revolver totaled $63 million and $0 as of December 31, 2017 and\\n2016, respectively. The revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes but may not be\\nused to fund dividend payments if the undrawn amount under the revolver is less than\\n$250 million.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier has two senior secured credit agreements with CoBank, ACB, as administrative agent,\\nlead arranger and a lender, and the other lenders party thereto: the first, drawn in 2011 (the 2011 CoBank\\nCredit Agreement), was refinanced on October 12, 2016 with a similar facility for $315 million, maturing on\\nOctober 12, 2021 (the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement), and the second, drawn in 2014 (the 2014 CoBank Credit\\nAgreement), matures on October 24, 2019.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn March 29, 2017, Frontier amended the 2014 and 2016 CoBank Credit Agreements. The amendments\\nprovide that interest rate margins under each of these facilities will range from 0.875% to 3.875% for Base\\nRate borrowings and 1.875% to 4.875% for LIBOR borrowings, subject to adjustment based on our Total Leverage\\nRatio, as defined in each credit agreement. The interest rate on each of the facilities as of December 31, 2017\\nwas LIBOR plus 3.875%. In addition, the amendments provide for increases in the maximum Leverage Ratio and\\nexpansion of the security package identical to those contained in the JPM Credit Agreement.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn January 25, 2018 Frontier further amended its credit agreements with JP\\nMorgan Chase and CoBank (JPM Credit Amendment). The\\namendments expand the security package to include interests of certain subsidiaries previously not pledged\\nand also update the net leverage ratio maintenance test\\ncovenant, which provides Frontier with greater flexibility in executing on operational\\ninitiatives going forward, as detailed in the section below.\\n\\ufeff\\nLetters of Credit Facility\\nFrontier has a Continuing Agreement for Standby Letters of Credit with\\nDeutsche Bank AG New York Branch and Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi UFJ, LTD. (the LC Agreements), Frontier can\\nalso issue letters of credit under the revolver up to a maximum of $134 million. As of December 31, 2017, $129\\nmillion and $63 million of undrawn Standby Letters of Credit had been issued under the LC\\nAgreements and revolver respectively. Borrowings under the LC\\nAgreements are secured by a security package identical to\\nthose contained in the JPM Credit Amendment.\\n\\ufeff\\nCovenants\\nThe terms and conditions contained in our indentures, the CoBank Credit Agreements, and the JPM\\nCredit Agreement include the timely payment of principal and interest when due, the maintenance of our\\ncorporate existence, keeping proper books and records in accordance with GAAP, restrictions on the incurrence\\nof liens on our assets securing indebtedness and our subsidiaries\\' assets, restrictions on the incurrence of\\nindebtedness by our subsidiaries and restrictions on asset sales and transfers, mergers and other changes in\\ncorporate control subject to important qualifications and exceptions. We would be restricted from declaring\\ndividends by the CoBank Credit Agreements and the JPM Credit Agreement if an event of default occurred and was\\ncontinuing at the time or would result from the dividend declaration. In addition, under the Certificate of\\nDesignations of our 11.125% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, we would be restricted from paying\\ndividends on our common stock if we failed to declare and pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe JPM Credit Amendment\\nreplaced Frontiers existing net leverage ratio test with a first lien net leverage ratio maintenance test which\\nprovides for a maximum first lien net leverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter,\\nstepping down to 1.35 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2020 and thereafter.

There are inherent uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions; accordingly, it\\nis possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the\\nnear term. The estimates which require the most significant judgment are listed below.\\n\\ufeff\\nThese critical accounting estimates have been reviewed with our independent registered public\\naccounting firm and with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For a discussion of these and other\\naccounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\n\\n48\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of our\\nability to collect accounts receivable. Our estimates are based on assumptions and other considerations,\\nincluding payment history, customer financial performance, carrier billing disputes and aging analysis. Our\\nestimation process includes general and specific reserves and varies by customer category. In\\n2017 and 2016, we had no \"critical estimates\" related to bankruptcies of communications companies or any other\\nsignificant customers. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\\n\\ufeff\\nIndefinite-lived Intangibles\\nOur indefinite-lived intangibles consist of goodwill and trade name, which\\nwere generated as a result of business combinations. We test for impairment of these assets annually as of\\nDecember 31 or more frequently, whenever events occur, or\\nfacts and circumstances change that make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has\\nbeen reduced below its carrying amount. Events that might indicate impairment include, but are not limited to,\\nstrategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic\\nenvironment on our customer base, material negative changes in relationships with significant customers, and/or\\na significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe early adopted ASU 2017-04 \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test\\nfor Goodwill Impairment\" (\"ASU 2017-04\") during the second quarter of 2017. In accordance with ASU 2017-04, our\\nannual goodwill impairment test (and interim test if determined to be necessary) will consist of comparing the\\nfair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair\\nvalue, an impairment will be recognized.\\n\\ufeff\\nFor the purpose of our goodwill impairment test, we first assess qualitative\\nfactors to determine if it is more likely than not that fair value of the reporting unit is less than the\\ncarrying amount. If it is less, an additional quantitative evaluation must be performed. Our quantitative\\nassessment consists of using a market multiples approach to determine fair value. Marketplace company\\ncomparisons and analyst reports within the wireline telecommunications industry have historically supported a range of fair values of multiples\\nbetween 4.4x and 6.5x annualized EBITDA (defined as operating income, net of acquisition and integration costs, pension/OPEB\\nexpense, pension settlement costs, stock-based compensation expense, goodwill impairment, storm-related costs,\\nand restructuring costs and other charges, as well as depreciation and amortization).\\n\\ufeff\\nDuring 2017, our common stock declined and traded at historically low prices.\\nAs a result, we tested goodwill for impairment in each of the four quarters in 2017. Our second and fourth quarter quantitative assessments indicated that the carrying value of the\\nenterprise exceeded its fair value and, therefore, an impairment existed. We recorded goodwill impairments\\ntotaling $2,748 million for 2017. The driver for the impairment in the second quarter was a reduction in our\\nprofitability and utilized EBITDA estimate, which when applied to our market multiple resulted in a lower\\nenterprise valuation. During the fourth quarter, the impairment was largely driven by a lower enterprise\\nvaluation resulting from a reduction in utilized market multiple from 5.8x to 5.5x reflecting\\nour lower stock price and a lower outlook for wireline communications companies. The revaluation of our net deferred tax\\nliabilities which resulted from the enactment of Tax Cut and Job Act, caused further goodwill impairment (see\\nNote 12). The first and third\\nquarter quantitative assessments, did not result in goodwill impairment charges. In estimating the enterprise\\nfair value we used 5.8x as the multiple for the first three quarters of 2017 and 5.5x\\nfor the fourth quarter test.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe market multiples approach that we use incorporates significant estimates and assumptions\\nrelated to the forecasted results for the remainder of the year, including revenues, expenses, and the\\nachievement of other cost synergies. Our assessment includes many qualitative factors that require significant\\njudgment. Alternative interpretations of these factors could have resulted in different conclusions regarding\\nthe need for, or size of, an impairment. Continued declines in our profitability or cash flows or in sustained\\nlow trading prices of our common stock may result in further impairment.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe enterprise fair value is sensitive to the amount of EBITDA generated by\\nFrontier and the EBITDA multiple used in the calculation. Significant changes in the assumptions or estimates\\nused in our impairment analyses, such as a reduction in profitability and/or cash flows, could result in a\\nnon-cash goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge and materially affect our operating\\nresults. The market multiples approach is sensitive to changes in the estimated annual EBITDA, with each $100\\nmillion change equating to approximately $550 million of\\nestimated enterprise value. Similarly, a ten-basis point change in the multiple used would affect the estimated enterprise value by\\napproximately $355 million. Sustained low trading prices for\\nour common stock could also affect the reconciliation of our market capitalization and indicate further\\nimpairment.\\n\\n\\n49\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nWe also considered whether the carrying values of finite-lived intangible\\nassets and property plant and equipment may not be recoverable or whether the carrying value of certain\\nfinite-lived intangible assets were impaired, noting no impairment was present as of\\nDecember 31, 2017.\\n\\ufeff\\nDepreciation and Amortization\\nThe calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based upon the\\nestimated useful lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and identifiable finite-lived intangible\\nassets. Depreciation expense is principally based on the composite group method for substantially all of our\\nproperty, plant and equipment assets. The estimates for remaining lives of the various asset categories are\\ndetermined annually, based on an independent study. Among other considerations, these studies include models\\nthat consider actual usage, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution for each category of\\nasset. The latest study was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017\\nand did not result in any significant changes in remaining lives for any of our asset\\ncategories. A one year decrease in the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment would result\\nin an increase of approximately $180 million to depreciation expense.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur finite-lived intangibles consist principally of customer base;\\n$2,760 million from the 2010 Acquisition, $570 million from the Connecticut Acquisition and $2,190 million from the\\nCTF Acquisition. These customer bases are being amortized on an\\naccelerated method because this method most closely resembles the projected underlying revenue streams. In\\nassigning lives, which range from between eight and 12 years, a separate evaluation and determination is made\\nfor consumer and commercial\\ncustomers.\\n\\ufeff\\nSee Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\\ndiscussion.\\n\\ufeff\\nAsset Impairments\\nWe review long-lived assets to be held and used, including customer lists and\\nlong-lived assets to be disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that\\nthe carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. When triggering events are\\nidentified, recoverability of assets to be held and used is\\nmeasured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be\\ngenerated by the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of\\nthe assets to their estimated fair market value. If any assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is\\nmeasured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value. Also, we\\nperiodically reassess the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets to determine whether any changes are required.\\n\\ufeff\\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\\nWe sponsor a defined benefit pension plan covering a significant number of\\nour current and former employees as well as other postretirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental,\\nlife insurance and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents.\\nAs of December 31, 2017, the unfunded benefit obligation for\\nthese plans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was $1,705 million. During\\n2017, we contributed $75\\nmillion to these plans net of the differential (see note 17),\\nand recorded $208 million of expense before\\ncapitalization, including $83 million of pension settlement\\ncosts and $5 million of special termination benefits. Pension\\nand other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions, the\\nmost significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of\\nreturn on plan assets.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our\\nactuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on\\nlong-term, high quality corporate bonds with durations approximate to that of our benefit obligation. As of\\nDecember 31, 2017, and\\n2016, we utilized an estimation technique that is based upon\\na settlement model (Bond:Link) that permits us to closely match cash flows to the expected payments to\\nparticipants. This rate can change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond\\nyields.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe are utilizing a discount rate of 3.70% as of December 31, 2017 for our qualified pension plan, compared to rates of 4.10% and 4.50% in\\n2016 and 2015, respectively. The discount rate for postretirement plans as of December 31, 2017 was a range of 3.70% to 3.80% compared to a range of 4.10% to 4.30% in 2016\\nand 4.50% to\\n4.70% in 2015.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n50\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\nIn the following table, we show the estimated sensitivity of our pension and\\nother postretirement benefit plan liabilities to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December\\n31, 2017:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n($ in millions)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncrease in Discount Rate of 25 bps\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDecrease in Discount Rate of 25 bps\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPension plans\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProjected benefit obligation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n(83)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n87\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther postretirement plans\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccumulated postretirement benefit obligation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n(36)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n38\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nIn developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we\\nconsidered published surveys of expected market returns, 10 and 20 year actual returns of various major\\nindices, and our own historical 5 year, 10 year and 20 year investment returns. The expected long-term rate of\\nreturn on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 40% in long-duration fixed income\\nsecurities, and 60% in equity securities and other investments. We review our asset allocation at least\\nannually and make changes when considered appropriate. Our asset return assumption is made at the beginning of\\nour fiscal year. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, our\\nexpected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 7.50%, 7.50% and 7.75%, respectively. Our actual\\nreturn on plan assets in 2017 was 16.50%. For 2018, we will assume a rate of return of\\n7.50%. Our pension plan assets are valued at fair value as of the measurement\\ndate.\\n\\ufeff\\nFor additional information regarding our pension and other postretirement\\nbenefits see Note 17 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements.\\n\\ufeff\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe file a consolidated federal income tax return. We utilize the asset and liability method of\\naccounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recorded for the\\ntax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and\\nliabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse.\\nActual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in governing law or review by taxing\\nauthorities.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe use a \"more likely than not\" threshold to the recognition and\\nderecognition of uncertain tax positions either taken or expected to be taken in Frontier\\'s income tax returns.\\nThe total amount of our gross tax liability for tax positions that may not be sustained under a \"more likely\\nthan not\" threshold amounts to $12 million as of December 31, 2017 including interest\\nof $1 million. For additional information regarding our\\naccounting for income taxes see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\ufeff\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe allocate the total cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets\\nbased on their respective estimated fair values. As part of this allocation process, we identify and attribute\\nvalues and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired. These determinations involve significant\\nestimates and assumptions about several highly subjective variables, including future cash flows, discount\\nrates, and asset lives. There are also different valuation models for each component, the selection of which\\nrequires considerable judgment. Our estimates and assumptions may be based, in part, on the availability of\\nlisted market prices or other transparent market data. These determinations will affect the amount of\\namortization expense recognized in future periods. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe\\nare reasonable, but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain. Depending on the size of the\\npurchase price of a particular acquisition and the mix of intangible assets acquired, the purchase price\\nallocation could be materially impacted by applying a different set of assumptions and estimates. Frontier\\nallocated $9,871 million and $2,018 million in total consideration to the \"fair market value\" of the assets\\nand liabilities acquired in the CTF Acquisition and the\\nConnecticut Acquisition, respectively. The estimates of the fair values assigned to property, plant and\\nequipment, customer list and goodwill, are more fully described in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements.\\n\\ufeff\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of this report\\nfor additional information related to recent accounting pronouncements.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n51\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n\\n\\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\\n\\ufeff\\nWe are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing\\ninvesting and funding activities, including those associated with our pension plan assets. Market risk refers\\nto the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates\\nand equity prices. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other\\nfinancial instruments for trading purposes. As a result, we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our\\nexposure to market risks, and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the\\nnormal course of business. Our primary market risk exposures from interest rate risk and equity price risk are\\nas follows:\\n\\ufeff\\nInterest Rate Exposure\\n\\ufeff\\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily\\nto the interest-bearing portion of our pension investment portfolio and the related actuarial liability for\\npension obligations, as well as our floating rate indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, 80% of our long-term debt had fixed interest rates. We had no interest rate swap\\nagreements related to our fixed rate or variable rate debt in\\neffect at December 31, 2017 and 2016. We believe that our currently outstanding obligation exposure to\\ninterest rate changes is minimal.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of\\ninterest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve\\nthese objectives, only 20%\\nof our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2017\\nhave floating interest rates. Our undrawn $850 million revolving credit facility has interest rates that float with the LIBO Rate, as defined.\\nConsequently, we have limited material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on\\nour debt. An adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable rate\\nobligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Based upon our\\noverall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2017, a\\nnear-term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of\\noperations or cash flows.\\n\\ufeff\\nAt December 31, 2017, the\\nfair value of our long-term debt was estimated to be approximately\\n$14 billion, based on prevailing interest rates, our overall\\nweighted average borrowing rate of 8.44% and\\nour overall weighted average maturity of approximately six\\nyears. As of December 31, 2017, there has\\nbeen no significant change in the weighted average maturity applicable to our obligations since December 31,\\n2016.\\n\\ufeff\\nEquity Price Exposure\\n\\ufeff\\nOur exposure to market risks for changes in equity security prices as of December 31, 2017 is\\nlimited to our pension plan assets. We have no other security investments of any significant amount.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur Pension Plan assets decreased from $2,766 million at December 31, 2016 to\\n$2,674 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of\\n$92 million, or 3%. This decrease was a result of benefit payments of\\n$544 million, primarily lump sum\\nsettlements of $486 million, partially offset by positive investment returns of\\n$378 million, net of investment management and administrative fees, and contributions in\\nexcess of the Differential (as defined below) of $74 million, during 2017.\\n\\ufeff\\nAs part of the CTF Acquisition, Verizon was required to make a cash payment\\nto Frontier for the difference in assets initially transferred by Verizon into the Pension Plan and the related\\nobligation (the Differential). During 2017, we received the $131 million Differential payment from Verizon, and\\nhave remitted an equivalent amount to the Pension Plan as of December 31, 2017. As the Differential was\\nreflected as a receivable of the Pension Plan at December 31, 2016, the cash funding had no impact to plan\\nassets.\\n\\ufeff\\nItem 8.

Those standards require\\nthat we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial\\nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing\\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due\\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining,\\non a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our\\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as\\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our\\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\n\\nAccompanying Supplemental Information\\n\\ufeff\\nThe supplemental information contained in the Schedule of Pledged Subsidiary Financial Data has\\nbeen subjected to audit procedures performed in conjunction with the audit of the Company\\'s consolidated\\nfinancial statements.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material\\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria\\nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting\\nOversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\"), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31,\\n2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, equity, and cash flows\\nfor each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively,\\nthe \"consolidated financial statements\"), and our report dated February 28, 2018 expressed an unqualified\\nopinion on those consolidated financial statements.\\nBasis for Opinion\\n\\ufeff\\nThe Company\\'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over\\nfinancial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,\\nincluded in the accompanying Management\\'s Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our\\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on our\\naudit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require\\nthat we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over\\nfinancial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial\\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk\\nthat a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal\\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered\\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\n\\ufeff\\nA company\\'s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide\\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\'s\\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the\\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\\nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\'s assets that\\ncould have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent\\nor detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to\\nthe risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n/s/ KPMG LLP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStamford,

Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Description of Business and Summary of\\nSignificant Accounting Policies:\\n(a) Description of Business:\\nFrontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) is the fourth largest\\nIncumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) in the United States, with approximately 4.9 million customers, 3.9 million broadband subscribers and 22,700\\nemployees, operating in 29 states. Frontier\\nwas incorporated in 1935, originally under the name of Citizens Utilities Company and was known as Citizens\\nCommunications Company until July 31, 2008. Frontier and its subsidiaries are referred to as \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\"\\n\"Frontier,\" or the \"Company\" in this report.\\n\\ufeff\\nEffective April 1, 2016, Frontier\\'s scope of operations and balance sheet changed materially\\nas a result of the completion of the CTF Acquisition, as described in Note 3 - Acquisitions. Historical\\nfinancial data presented for Frontier is not indicative of the future financial position or operating results\\nfor Frontier, and includes the results of the CTF Operations, as defined in Note 3 - Acquisitions, from the\\ndate of acquisition on April 1, 2016.\\n\\ufeff\\n(b) Basis of Presentation and Use of\\nEstimates:\\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting\\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Certain reclassifications of amounts\\npreviously reported have been made to conform to the current presentation. All significant intercompany\\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\\n\\ufeff\\nFor our financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2017, we evaluated\\nsubsequent events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through the date that we filed this\\nForm 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\\n\\ufeff\\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to\\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of\\nthe financial statements, (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and (iii) the reported\\namounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\\nEstimates and judgments are used when accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts, asset impairments,\\nindefinite-lived intangibles, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, business combinations, and pension\\nand other postretirement benefits, among others.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn July 10, 2017, we effected a one for fifteen reverse stock split of our common stock. The reverse stock split reduced\\nthe number of common shares issued (which includes outstanding shares and treasury shares) from\\napproximately 1,193,000,000 shares to 80,000,000 shares, and reduced shares outstanding from 1,178,000,000 shares to 79,000,000 shares. In addition, and at the same time, the total number of shares of common stock that Frontier is\\nauthorized to issue changed from 1,750,000,000 shares\\nto 175,000,000 shares. There was no change in the par value\\nof the common stock, and no fractional shares were issued.\\nAll share and per share amounts in the financial statements and footnotes have been retroactively adjusted for\\nall periods presented to give effect to the reverse stock split. As a result of our reverse stock split the\\nconversion rates of our Series A Preferred Stock were proportionately adjusted.\\n\\ufeff\\n(c) Cash Equivalents:\\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three\\nmonths or less to be cash equivalents. Restricted cash of $14 million is included within \"Income taxes and other current assets\" on our\\nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. This amount represents funds held as collateral by certain\\ninsurance carriers, of which $7 million was released in\\nJanuary 2018, and the remainder expected to be released in the first quarter of 2018.\\n\\ufeff\\n(d) Revenue Recognition:\\nRevenue\\nis recognized when services are provided or when products are delivered to customers. Revenue that is billed in\\nadvance includes monthly recurring network access services (including data services), special access services\\nand monthly recurring voice, video and related charges. The unearned portion of these fees is initially\\ndeferred as a component of \"Advanced billings\" on our consolidated balance sheet and recognized as revenue over\\nthe period that the services are provided. Revenue that is billed in arrears includes non-recurring network\\naccess services (including data services), switched access services and non-recurring voice\\n\\n\\nF-9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\nand video services. The earned but unbilled portion of these fees is recognized as revenue in\\nour consolidated statements of operations and accrued in \"Accounts Receivable\" on our consolidated balance\\nsheet in the period that the services are provided. Excise taxes are recognized as a liability when billed.\\nInstallation fees and their related direct and incremental costs are initially deferred and recognized as\\nrevenue and expense over the average term of a customer relationship. We recognize as current period expense\\nthe portion of installation costs that exceeds installation fee revenue.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier collects\\nvarious taxes from its customers and subsequently remits these taxes to governmental authorities. Substantially\\nall of these taxes are recorded through the consolidated balance sheet and presented on a net basis in our\\nconsolidated statements of operations. We also collect Universal Service Fund (USF) surcharges from customers\\n(primarily federal USF) that we have recorded on a gross basis in our consolidated statements of operations and\\nincluded within \"Revenue\" and \"Network related expenses\" of $216 million, $217 million and $151 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,\\nrespectively.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn 2015 we accepted the FCC\\'s Connect America Fund (CAF) Phase II offer of support, which is a\\nsuccessor to and augments the USF frozen high cost support that we had been receiving pursuant to a 2011 FCC\\norder. Upon completion of the CTF Acquisition, Frontier assumed the CAF Phase II support and related\\nobligations that Verizon had previously accepted with regard to California and Texas. CAF Phase II funding is a\\nprogram intended to subsidize the high cost of establishing and delivering communications services to certain\\nunserved or underserved areas. We are recognizing these subsidies into revenue on a straight line basis, which\\nis consistent with how the costs related to these subsidies are being and are expected to be incurred. CAF\\nPhase II is a multi-year program which requires us to deploy broadband to a specified number of households in\\neach of the states where funding was accepted. Failure to meet our deployment obligations at the end of the\\nprogram in 2020 will result in a return of a portion of the funding received. We regularly evaluate our ability\\nto meet our broadband deployment obligations and adjust revenue accordingly.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe categorize our products, services and other revenues among the following five\\ncategories:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nData and Internet services include broadband\\nservices for consumer and commercial customers. We provide data transmission services to high volume commercial\\ncustomers and other carriers with dedicated high capacity circuits (\"nonswitched access\") including services to\\nwireless providers (\"wireless backhaul\");\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVoice services include traditional local and\\nlong-distance wireline services, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, as well as a number of unified\\nmessaging services offered to our consumer and commercial customers. Voice services also include the\\nlong-distance voice origination and termination services that we provide to our commercial customers and other\\ncarriers;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVideo services include revenues generated from\\nservices provided directly to consumer customers through the FiOS®\\nand Vantage video brands, and through DISH® satellite TV services;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther customer revenue includes sales of customer\\npremise equipment to our commercial customers and directory services, less our provision for bad debts;\\nand\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n·\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSwitched Access and Subsidy revenues include\\nrevenues derived from allowing other carriers to use our network to originate and/or terminate their local and\\nlong-distance voice traffic (\"switched access\"). These services are primarily billed on a minutes-of-use basis\\napplying tariffed rates filed with the FCC or state agencies. We also receive cost subsidies from state and\\nfederal authorities, including the Connect America Fund Phase II.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\nF-10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following table provides a summary of revenues from external customers by the categories\\nof Frontier\\'s products and services:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the year ended December 31,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n($ in millions)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nData and Internet services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n3,862\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n3,693\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,337\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVoice services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2,864\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2,886\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2,022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVideo services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,304\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,244\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n285\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n322\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n276\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n255\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomer revenue\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8,352\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8,099\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4,899\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSwitched access and subsidy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n776\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n797\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n677\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal revenue\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n9,128\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,896\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,576\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n(e) Property, Plant and\\nEquipment:\\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at original cost, including capitalized interest, or\\nfair market value as of the date of acquisition for acquired properties. Maintenance and repairs are charged to\\noperating expenses as incurred. The gross book value of routine property, plant and equipment retirements is\\ncharged against accumulated depreciation.\\n\\ufeff\\n(f) Goodwill and Other\\nIntangibles:\\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable tangible\\nand intangible net assets acquired. We undertake studies to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities\\nacquired and allocate purchase prices to assets and liabilities, including property, plant and equipment,\\ngoodwill and other identifiable intangibles. We examine the carrying value of our goodwill and trade name\\nannually as of December 31, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant, to determine whether there are any\\nimpairment losses. We test for goodwill impairment at the \"operating segment\" level, as that term is defined in\\nGAAP.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe determined that we have one\\noperating segment based on a number of factors that our management uses to evaluate and run\\nour business operations, including similarities of customers, products and technology. We tested goodwill for\\nimpairment as of December 31, 2017 as a result of the continued decline in share price of our common stock\\nsince September 30, 2017, the date of our last goodwill impairment test. Refer to Note 6 for a discussion of\\nour goodwill impairment testing and results as of December 31, 2017. As stated in Note 2, we early adopted ASU\\nNo. 2017-04, \"Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\" during 2017 in conjunction with our goodwill\\nimpairment assessment.\\n\\ufeff\\nFrontier amortizes finite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on the\\naccelerated method of sum of the years digits. We review such intangible assets at least annually as of\\nDecember 31 to assess whether any potential impairment exists and whether factors exist that would necessitate\\na change in useful life and a different amortization period.\\n\\ufeff\\n(g) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and\\nLong-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of:\\nWe review long-lived assets to be held and used, including customer lists, and long-lived\\nassets to be disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\\namount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by\\ncomparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated\\nby the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets\\nto their estimated fair market value. If any assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured\\nby the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value. Also, we\\nperiodically reassess the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets to determine whether any changes\\nare required.\\n\\n\\n\\nF-11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(h) Income Taxes and Deferred Income\\nTaxes:\\nWe file a consolidated federal income tax return. We utilize the asset and liability method of\\naccounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recorded for the\\ntax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and\\nliabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to\\nreverse.\\n\\ufeff\\n(i) Stock Plans:\\nWe have various stock-based compensation plans. Awards under these plans are granted to\\neligible employees and directors. Awards may be made in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified\\nstock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units or other stock-based awards,\\nincluding awards with performance, market and time-vesting conditions. Our general policy is to issue shares\\nfrom treasury upon the grant of restricted shares, earning of performance shares and the exercise of\\noptions.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe compensation cost recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest. GAAP requires\\nforfeitures to be estimated and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from\\nthose estimates.\\n\\ufeff\\n(j) Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Frontier\\nCommon Shareholders:\\nBasic net loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares\\noutstanding during the period being reported on, excluding unvested restricted stock awards. The impact of\\ndividends paid on unvested restricted stock awards have been deducted in the determination of basic and diluted\\nnet income (loss) per share attributable to Frontier common shareholders. Except when the effect would be\\nantidilutive, diluted net income per common share reflects the dilutive effect of certain common stock\\nequivalents, as described further in Note 13 - Net Loss Per Common Share.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n(2) Recent Accounting\\nPronouncements:\\n\\ufeff\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\n\\ufeff\\nRevenue Recognition\\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards\\nUpdate (ASU) No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\" This standard, along with its related\\namendments, requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to\\ncustomers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which they expect to be entitled in exchange for\\nthose goods or services. This new standard will be adopted by Frontier for annual and interim reporting periods\\nbeginning with the first quarter of 2018.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe FASB allows two adoption methods under ASC 606. Companies are permitted to either apply\\nthe requirements retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or apply the requirements in the year of\\nadoption, through a cumulative adjustment. We currently plan to adopt the standard in the first quarter of\\n2018, using the \"modified retrospective method.\" Under that method, we will apply the rules to all contracts\\nexisting as of January 1, 2018, recognizing, in beginning retained earnings, a cumulative-effect adjustment to\\ninclude the establishment of contract asset and contract liability accounts with a corresponding adjustment to\\nretained earnings. We will also provide additional disclosures comparing revenue recognized under ASC 606 to\\nrevenue as reported prior to the adoption of the standard.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe key changes in the standard that impact our\\nrevenue recognition relate to the allocation of contract revenues among various services and equipment, and the\\ntiming of when those revenues are recognized. Additionally, the new standard will impact the timing of\\nrecognizing costs to obtain contracts. This includes a change in our existing policy related to the way we\\naccount for the allocation of discounts, customer\\nincentives, upfront non-recurring charges, customer disputes and commission payments.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe are implementing changes to our systems, processes,\\npolicies and internal controls to meet the standard\\'s reporting and disclosure requirements.\\nWe believe the changes will impact service revenue categorization as\\n\\n\\nF-12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\nwell as Selling, general and administrative expenses, however, we do not anticipate its impact will be material to operating income.\\n\\ufeff\\nLeases\\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016 - 02, \"Leases (Topic\\n842).\" This standard, along with its related\\namendments, establishes the principles to report transparent and economically\\nneutral information about the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. Upon implementation,\\nlessees will need to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a\\nright-of-use asset and a lease liability. It will be critical to identify leases embedded in a contract to\\navoid misstating the lessee\\'s balance sheet. The income statement impacts of the\\nleases will depend on the nature of the leasing arrangement and will be similar to existing accounting for\\noperating and capital leases. Classification will be based on criteria that are\\nlargely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. Lessor\\naccounting is similar to the current model, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and\\nthe new revenue recognition standard. Existing sale-leaseback guidance, including guidance for real estate, is\\nreplaced with a new model applicable to both lessees and lessors. The new guidance\\nis effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal\\nyears using modified retrospective application. Early application is\\npermitted. Frontier is in the initial stages of\\nevaluating the potential impact this new standard may have on the consolidated financial statements.\\n\\ufeff\\nCompensation - Retirement Benefits\\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, \"Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic\\nPension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost\". This standard was established to improve the\\npresentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost by requiring that an\\nemployer disaggregate the service cost component of periodic benefit cost from the other components of net\\nbenefit cost. The amendments in the update also provide explicit guidance on how to present the service cost\\ncomponent and other components of net benefit cost in the income statement and allow only the service cost\\ncomponents of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization. The new guidance is effective for annual\\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods and requires\\nthe presentation of the income statement to be applied retrospectively. As a result of the standard, pension\\nsettlement costs and certain benefit costs which are currently included in operating expense, would be reported\\nas other non-operating expense and will no longer be capitalized. This will have a material impact on\\npreviously reported operating income and may have a material impact to operating income in future periods,\\nhowever, the impact to pre-tax income is not expected to be material.\\n\\ufeff\\nReclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\\nIn February 2018, FASB issued ASU 2018-02, which allows for the reclassification of certain income tax effects\\nrelated to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") between \"Accumulated other comprehensive income\" and\\n\"Retained earnings.\" This ASU relates to the requirement that adjustments to deferred tax liabilities and\\nassets related to a change in tax laws or rates to be included in \"Income from continuing operations\", even in\\nsituations where the related items were originally recognized in \"Other comprehensive income\" (rather than in\\n\"Income from continuing operations\"). The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal\\nyears beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption\\npermitted. Adoption of this ASU is to be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each\\nperiod in which the effect of the change in the tax laws or rates were recognized.

This standard provides guidance on\\nthe types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards to which an entity would be\\nrequired to apply modification accounting under ASC 718. Specifically, an entity would not apply modification\\naccounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the awards are the same immediately\\nbefore and after the modification. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December\\n15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods and early adoption is permitted including in\\nany interim period. Frontier has adopted this standard during the second quarter 2017, with no impact to our\\nshare-based payment awards.\\n\\ufeff\\nIntangibles - Goodwill\\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, \"Simplifying the Test for\\nGoodwill Impairment.\" This standard was established to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for\\nimpairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a\\ngoodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit\\'s goodwill with the carrying\\namount of that goodwill. Under the amendments in this Update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim,\\ngoodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity\\nshould recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\\'s\\nfair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that\\nreporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on\\nthe carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The FASB\\nalso eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a\\nqualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment\\ntest. Therefore, the same impairment assessment applies to all reporting units. An entity is required to\\ndisclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net\\nassets. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine\\nif the quantitative impairment test is necessary. Frontier early adopted this standard during\\nin 2017 in conjunction with our goodwill impairment assessment. See\\nNote 1 and Note 6 for further discussion.\\n\\ufeff\\nCompensation - Stock Compensation\\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee\\nShare-Based Payment Accounting,\" to amend ASC Topic 718, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation.\" The ASU is part\\nof the FASB\\'s ongoing simplification initiative, which is designed to reduce cost and complexity while\\nmaintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to the users of financial statements. The\\nsimplifications address a variety of areas for public entities, including the following: 1) accounting for\\nincome taxes, 2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, 3) forfeitures, 4)\\nminimum statutory tax withholding requirements, 5) classifications of employee taxes paid on the statement of\\ncash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax withholding purposes, and 6) classification of awards with\\nrepurchase features. This guidance was effective for Frontier as of the third quarter of 2017. During\\nthe year ended December\\n31, 2017 Frontier recognized $1 million of income tax expense and recorded a\\ncumulative effect adjustment to beginning accumulated deficit of $1\\nmillion to recognize all unrecognized deferred tax benefits recorded as of January 1, 2017.\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Frontier reclassified $10 million and $14 million,\\nrespectively, of taxes paid on\\nbehalf of employees related to shares withheld from \"Cash flows provided from (used by) operations\" to \"Cash\\nflows used by financing activities\" in accordance with the new standard.\\n\\ufeff\\n(3) Acquisitions:\\n\\ufeff\\nThe CTF Acquisition\\nOn April 1, 2016, Frontier acquired the wireline operations of Verizon\\nCommunications, Inc. in California, Texas and Florida for a purchase price of $10,540 million in cash and assumed debt (the CTF Acquisition), pursuant to the\\nFebruary 5, 2015 Securities Purchase Agreement, as amended.

These measurement period adjustments resulted in $20\\nmillion of amortization expense during the first quarter of 2017 that would have been\\nrecorded in 2016 if the adjustments had been recognized as of the acquisition date. Other adjustments to the\\nallocation of the purchase price for the CTF Acquisition during the first quarter of 2017 resulted in a\\n$140 million decrease in Property, plant & equipment,\\na $61 million increase in Current liabilities, and\\na $98 million increase in Goodwill.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe total consideration exceeded the net estimated fair value of the assets\\nacquired and liabilities assumed by $2,606 million, which we\\nrecognized as goodwill.

Due to the continued decline in our stock\\nprice we had triggering events in each of the four quarters in 2017.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe use a market multiples approach to determine fair value. Marketplace\\ncompany comparisons and analyst reports within the wireline telecommunications industry have historically supported a range of fair values of multiples\\nbetween 4.4x and 6.5x annualized EBITDA (defined as operating income, net\\nof acquisition and integration costs, pension/OPEB expense, pension settlement costs, stock-based compensation\\nexpense, goodwill impairment, storm-related costs, and restructuring costs and other charges, as well as\\ndepreciation and amortization). We estimated the enterprise fair value using a multiple of 5.8x EBITDA for the first three quarters in 2017 and a multiple of\\n5.5x EBITDA for the fourth quarter evaluation.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur second and fourth quarter quantitative assessments indicated that the carrying value of\\nthe enterprise exceeded its fair value and, therefore, an impairment existed. We elected to early adopt the\\nsimplified goodwill testing method under ASU 2017-04, recording goodwill impairments totaling $2,748 million\\nfor 2017. The driver for the impairment in the second quarter was a reduction in our profitability and utilized\\nEBITDA estimate, which when applied to our market multiple resulted in a lower enterprise valuation. During the\\nfourth quarter, the impairment was largely driven by a lower enterprise valuation resulting from a reduction in\\nutilized market multiple from 5.8x to 5.5x reflecting the lower outlook for our industry as a whole. The\\nrevaluation of our net\\n\\n\\nF-18\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\ndeferred tax liabilities which resulted from the enactment of Tax Cut and Job Act, caused\\nfurther goodwill impairment (see Note 12).\\n\\ufeff\\nOur first and third quarter quantitative assessments indicated that the fair value of the\\nenterprise exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, no indication of impairment existed in either\\nperiod.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe market multiples approach that we use incorporates significant estimates and assumptions\\nrelated to the forecasted results for the remainder of the year including revenues, expenses, and the\\nachievement of other cost synergies. Our assessment includes many qualitative factors that require significant\\njudgment. Alternative interpretations of these factors could have resulted in different conclusions regarding\\nthe need for, or size of, an impairment. Continued declines in our profitability or cash flows or in the\\nsustained, historically low trading prices of our common stock may result in further impairment.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe also considered whether the carrying values of finite-lived intangible assets and property\\nplant and equipment may not be recoverable or whether the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived intangible\\nassets were impaired, noting no additional impairment was present as of December 31, 2017.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe components of other intangibles at December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as\\nfollows:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n($ in millions)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGross Carrying Amount\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccumulated Amortization\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNet Carrying Amount\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGross Carrying Amount\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccumulated Amortization\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNet Carrying Amount\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Intangibles:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomer base\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,188\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n(3,294)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,894\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,088\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n(2,604)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,484\\n\\n\\n\\nTrade name\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n122\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n122\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n122\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n122\\n\\n\\n\\nRoyalty agreement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n72\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(25)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n47\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n72\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(16)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n56\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal other intangibles\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,382\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n(3,319)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,063\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,282\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n(2,620)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,662\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\nAmortization expense was as follows:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the Year Ended\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n($ in millions)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmortization expense\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n699\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n643\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n337\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nAmortization expense primarily represents the amortization of our customer base acquired as a result of the CTF Acquisition, the Connecticut Acquisition and the acquisition of certain\\nVerizon properties in 2010 with each based on a useful life of 8 to 12 years on an accelerated method.\\nThe approximate weighted average remaining life of our customer base is 6 years and for our royalty agreement is 3\\nyears.

Each was issued at a price equal\\nto 100% of its principal amount. Frontier used the net\\nproceeds from the offering (after deducting underwriting fees) to finance a portion of the cash consideration\\npaid in connection with the CTF Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. The net proceeds of the debt\\noffering of $6,485 million were included in \"Restricted cash\"\\nin the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.

A pretax loss of approximately $7\\nmillion was recognized and included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year\\nended December 31, 2016.\\n\\ufeff\\nDuring 2015, Frontier used cash available on hand for the scheduled\\nretirement of $97 million of 7.875% Senior Notes, and $105 million 6.625% Senior Notes at maturity.\\n\\ufeff\\nTerm Loans and Credit Facilities\\nOn February 27, 2017, Frontier entered into a first amended and restated\\ncredit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto,\\npursuant to which Frontier combined its revolving credit agreement, dated as of June 2, 2014, and its term loan\\ncredit agreement, dated as of August 12, 2015. Under the JPM Credit Agreement, as further amended on June 15,\\n2017 by Increase Joinder No.1 (as so amended, the JPM Credit Agreement), Frontier has a $1,625 million senior secured term loan A facility (the Term Loan A) maturing\\non March 31, 2021, an $850\\nmillion undrawn secured revolving credit facility maturing on February 27, 2022 (the Revolver), and $1,500\\nmillion senior secured term loan B facility (the Term Loan B) maturing on\\nJune 15, 2024. The maturities of the Term Loan A, the Revolver,\\nand the Term Loan B, in each case if still outstanding, will be accelerated in the following circumstances: (i)\\nif, 91 days before the maturity date of any series of\\nSenior Notes maturing in 2020, 2023 and 2024, more than $500 million in principal amount remains outstanding on such series; or (ii) if, 91 days before the maturity\\ndate of the first series of Senior Notes maturing in 2021 or 2022, more than $500 million in principal amount\\nremains outstanding, in the aggregate, on the two series of Senior Notes maturing in such year. The\\ndetermination of interest rates for each of the facilities under the JPM Credit Agreement is based on margins\\nover the Base Rate (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement) or over LIBOR, at the election of Frontier.\\nInterest rate margins on the Term Loan A and Revolver (ranging from 0.75%\\nto 1.75% for Base Rate borrowings\\nand 1.75% to 2.75%\\nfor LIBOR borrowings) are subject to adjustment based on Frontier\\'s Total Leverage Ratio (as\\ndefined in the JPM Credit Agreement). The interest rate on the Term Loan A as of December 31, 2017 was LIBOR\\nplus 2.75%. Interest rate margins on the Term Loan B\\n(2.75% for Base Rate borrowings and 3.75% for LIBOR borrowings) are not subject to adjustment. The security\\npackage under the JPM Credit Agreement includes pledges of the equity interests in certain Frontier\\nsubsidiaries and guaranties by certain Frontier subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017\\nno borrowing had been made under the revolving credit facility. Letters of credit, which may be issued under\\nthe revolver up to a maximum of $134 million, reduce\\navailable borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility.

The remaining outstanding principal balances to be repaid on the maturity\\ndate.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn March 29, 2017, Frontier amended the 2014 and 2016 CoBank Credit\\nAgreements. The amendments provide that interest rate margins under each of these facilities will range\\nfrom 0.875% to 3.875%\\nfor Base Rate borrowings and 1.875% to 4.875% for LIBOR borrowings, subject to\\nadjustment based on our Total Leverage Ratio, as defined in each credit agreement. The interest rate on each of\\nthe facilities as of December 31, 2017 was LIBOR plus 3.875%. In addition, the amendments provide for increases in the maximum Leverage Ratio and expansion of the\\nsecurity package identical to those contained in the JPM Credit Agreement.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn January 25, 2018 Frontier further amended its credit agreements with JP Morgan Chase and\\nCoBank (JPM Credit Amendment). The amendments expanded the security package to include interests of certain\\nsubsidiaries previously not pledged and replaced the net leverage ratio maintenance test with a first lien net\\nleverage ratio maintenance test.\\n\\ufeff\\nDuring 2015, we entered into secured financings totaling $3 million with four year\\nterms and no stated interest rate for certain equipment purchases.\\n\\ufeff\\nAs of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our debt and credit facility\\ncovenants.\\n\\ufeff\\nOur scheduled principal payments are as follows as of December 31,\\n2017:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrincipal\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n($ in millions)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPayments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2018\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n656\\n\\n\\n\\n2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n804\\n\\n\\n\\n2020\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,132\\n\\n\\n\\n2021\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,558\\n\\n\\n\\n2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,703\\n\\n\\n\\nThereafter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n10,010\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\nF-23\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Obligations\\nDuring 2016, Frontier\\ncontributed a real estate property with a fair value of $15 million for the purpose of funding a portion of its contribution obligations to its qualified defined\\nbenefit pension plan. The pension plan obtained independent appraisals of\\nthe property and, based on these appraisals, the pension plan recorded the contribution at\\nits fair value of $15 million. Frontier has entered into a\\nlease for the contributed property with initial terms of 15 years at a combined aggregate annual rent of approximately $2\\nmillion. The property is managed on behalf of the pension plan by an independent fiduciary,\\nand the terms of the lease were negotiated with the fiduciary on an arm\\'s-length basis.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe contribution and leaseback of the property was treated as a financing\\ntransaction and, accordingly, Frontier continues to depreciate the carrying value of\\nthe property in its financial statements and no gain or loss\\nwas recognized. An obligation of $15 million was recorded in\\nour consolidated balance sheet within \"Other liabilities\" and the liability is reduced annually by a portion of\\nthe lease payments made to the pension plan.\\n\\ufeff\\nDuring 2017 and 2016, Frontier modified certain operating leases for vehicles which resulted in the classification as capital\\nleases.

The amount and timing of dividends\\npayable on common and preferred stock are, subject to applicable law, within the sole discretion of our Board\\nof Directors.\\n\\ufeff\\nCommon Stock Offering\\nOn June 10, 2015, prior to the reverse stock split\\n(see Footnote 1) we completed a registered offering of 150,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.25 per share, at an offering price of $5\\nper share. On June\\n\\n\\nF-25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n24, 2015, Frontier issued an additional 15,000,000 shares of common stock in connection with the over-allotment option\\nthat was exercised in full by the underwriters. Aggregate net proceeds were approximately $799 million after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. We used the net\\nproceeds from this offering to fund a portion of the acquisition price of the CTF Acquisition and related fees\\nand expenses.\\n\\ufeff\\nMandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A) Offering\\nOn June 10, 2015, prior to the reverse stock\\nsplit, we completed a registered offering of 17,500,000 shares of our 11.125% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01\\nper share (the \"Series A Preferred Stock\"), at an offering price of $100 per share. On June 24, 2015, Frontier issued an additional\\n1,750,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in connection with the\\nover-allotment option that was exercised in full by the underwriters. Aggregate net proceeds of the offering\\nwere $1,866 million after deducting commissions and estimated\\nexpenses. We used the net proceeds from this offering to fund a portion of the acquisition price of the CTF\\nAcquisition and related fees and expenses.\\n\\ufeff\\nUnless converted earlier, each share of the Series A Preferred Stock will\\nautomatically convert on June 29, 2018 into common stock, (between 1.1348\\nand 1.3333 shares on a post-split basis) depending on the applicable market value of our common\\nstock, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. Subject to certain restrictions, at any time prior to June 29,\\n2018, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may elect to convert all or a portion of their shares into common\\nstock at the minimum conversion rate then in effect.\\n\\ufeff\\nDividends on shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are payable on a\\ncumulative basis when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors (or an authorized committee thereof) at an\\nannual rate of 11.125% on the liquidation preference\\nof $100.00 per share, on the last business day of March,\\nJune, September and December of each year, commencing on September 30, 2015 to, and including, the mandatory\\nconversion date. Series A Preferred Stock dividends of $214 million, $214 million, and $120 million were paid in 2017, 2016, and 2015 respectively.\\n\\ufeff\\nPursuant to the terms of the CTF Acquisition, $1,955 million of the $2,665 million in net proceeds from the equity offerings were deposited into escrow and were included in\\n\"Restricted cash\" in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. Upon closing of the CTF\\nAcquisition, the funds were released and used to fund a portion of the purchase price.\\n\\ufeff\\n(11) Stock Plans:\\nAt December 31, 2017, we had seven\\nstock-based compensation plans under which grants were made and awards remained outstanding.\\nNo further awards may be granted under six of the plans: the\\n1996 Equity Incentive Plan (the 1996 EIP), the Amended and Restated 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 EIP),\\nthe 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2009 EIP), the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2013 EIP), the Deferred Fee\\nPlan and the Directors\\' Equity Plan. At December 31, 2017, there were approximately 5,667,000 shares authorized for grant and approximately 4,361,000 shares available for grant under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2017 EIP and together with the 1996\\nEIP, the 2000 EIP, the 2009 EIP and the 2013 EIPS, the EIPs). Our general policy is to issue treasury shares\\nupon the grant of restricted shares and the exercise of options.\\n\\ufeff\\n1996, 2000, 2009, 2013, and 2017 Equity Incentive Plans\\nSince the expiration dates of the 1996 EIP, the 2000 EIP, the 2009 EIP, and\\nthe 2013 EIP on May 22, 2006, May 14, 2009, May 8, 2013, and May 10, 2017, respectively, no awards have been or\\nmay be granted under the 1996 EIP, the 2000 EIP, the 2009 EIP, and the 2013 EIP.\\nUnder the 2017 EIP, awards of our common stock may be granted to eligible employees in the form of incentive\\nstock options, non-qualified stock options, SARs, restricted stock, performance shares or other stock-based\\nawards. As discussed under the Non-Employee Directors\\' Compensation Plans below, prior to May 25, 2006\\nnon-employee directors received an award of stock options under the 2000 EIP upon commencement of\\nservice. No awards may be granted more than 10\\nyears after the effective date (May 10, 2017) of the 2017 EIP plan. The exercise price of\\nstock options and SARs under the EIPs generally are equal to or greater than the fair market value of the\\nunderlying common stock on the date of grant. Stock options are not ordinarily exercisable on the date of grant\\nbut vest over a period of time (generally four years).\\nUnder the terms of the EIPs, subsequent stock dividends and stock splits have the effect of increasing the\\noption shares outstanding, which correspondingly decrease the average exercise price of outstanding\\noptions.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\nF-26\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\nPerformance Shares\\nOn February 15, 2012, Frontier\\'s Compensation Committee, in consultation\\nwith the other non-management directors of Frontier\\'s Board of Directors and the Committee\\'s independent\\nexecutive compensation consultant, adopted the Frontier Long-Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP). LTIP awards are\\ngranted in the form of performance shares. The LTIP is currently offered under Frontier\\'s 2009\\nEIP, 2013 EIP and 2017\\nEIP, and participants consist of senior vice presidents and above. The LTIP awards\\nhave performance, market and time-vesting conditions.\\n\\ufeff\\nBeginning in 2012, during the first 90\\ndays of a three-year performance period (a\\nMeasurement Period), a target number of performance shares are awarded to each LTIP participant with respect to\\nthe Measurement Period. The performance metrics under the LTIP are (1) annual targets for operating cash flow\\nbased on a goal set during the first 90 days of each year in the three-year Measurement Period and (2) an\\noverall performance \"modifier\" set during the first 90 days of the Measurement Period, based on Frontier\\'s\\ntotal return to stockholders (i.e., Total Shareholder Return or TSR) relative to the Integrated\\nTelecommunications Services Group (GICS Code 50101020) for the three-year Measurement Period. Operating cash\\nflow performance is determined at the end of each year and the annual results will be averaged at the end of\\nthe three-year Measurement Period to determine the preliminary number of shares earned under the LTIP award.\\nThe TSR performance measure is then applied to decrease or increase payouts based on Frontier\\'s three year\\nrelative TSR performance. LTIP awards, to the extent earned, will be paid out in the form of common stock\\nshortly following the end of the three-year Measurement Period.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn February 25, 2015, the Compensation Committee\\ngranted approximately 665,000 performance shares under the\\nLTIP and set the operating cash flow performance goal for 2015, which applies to the first year in the\\n2015-2017 measurement period, the second year of the 2014-2016 measurement period and the third year of the\\n2013-2015 measurement period. On February 11, 2016, the Compensation Committee\\ngranted approximately 1,669,000 performance shares under\\nthe LTIP and set the operating cash flow performance goal for 2016, which applies to the first year in the\\n2016-2018 measurement period, the second year of the 2015-2017 measurement period and the third year of the\\n2014-2016 measurement period. On February 16, 2017, the Compensation Committee of our\\nBoard of Directors granted approximately 157,400 performance shares under the Frontier Long Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP) and set the operating cash\\nflow performance goal for 2017, which applies to the first year in the 2017-2019 measurement period, the second\\nyear of the 2016-2018 measurement period and the third year of the 2015-2017 measurement period.\\nThe number of shares of common stock earned at the end of each three-year Measurement Period\\nmay be more or less than the number of target performance shares granted as a result of operating cash flow and\\nTSR performance. An executive must maintain a satisfactory performance rating during the Measurement Period and\\nmust be employed by Frontier at the end of the three-year Measurement Period in order for the award to vest.\\nThe Compensation Committee will determine the number of shares earned for each three year Measurement Period in\\nFebruary of the year following the end of the Measurement Period.\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\nF-27\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following summary presents information regarding LTIP target performance\\nshares as of December 31, 2017 and changes during the three\\nyears then ended with regard to LTIP shares awarded under the 2009 EIP,\\n2013 EIP, and 2017 EIP:\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNumber of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShares\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(in thousands)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBalance at December 31, 2014\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n179\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares granted\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n49\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares earned\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(50)\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares forfeited\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\n\\nBalance at December 31, 2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n168\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares granted\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n111\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares earned\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(59)\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares forfeited\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(30)\\n\\n\\n\\nBalance at December 31, 2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n190\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares granted\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n211\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares earned\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(41)\\n\\n\\n\\nLTIP target performance shares forfeited\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(54)\\n\\n\\n\\nBalance at December 31, 2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n306\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nFor purposes of determining compensation expense, the fair value of each\\nperformance share is measured at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on the\\nprice of Frontier common stock as well as performance relative to the targets.

Total remaining unrecognized compensation cost associated with unvested\\nrestricted stock awards that is deferred at December 31, 2017 was $21 million and the\\nweighted average vesting period over which this cost is expected to be recognized is approximately\\n1.2 years.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe have granted restricted stock awards to employees in the form of our\\ncommon stock. None of the restricted stock awards may be sold, assigned, pledged or otherwise transferred,\\nvoluntarily or involuntarily, by the employees until the restrictions lapse, subject to limited exceptions. The\\nrestrictions are time-based. Compensation expense, recognized in \"Selling, general and administrative\\nexpenses\", of $18\\nmillion, $18 million and\\n$20 million, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and\\n2015, respectively, has been recorded in connection with these grants.\\n\\ufeff\\nNon-Employee Directors\\' Compensation Plans\\nAs of October 1, 2013, stock units are credited to the director\\'s account in\\nan amount that is determined as follows: the total cash value of the fees payable to the director is divided by\\nthe closing price of Frontier common stock on the grant date of the units. Units are credited to the director\\'s\\naccount quarterly. Directors must also elect to convert the units to either common stock (convertible on a\\none-to-one basis) or cash upon retirement or death.\\n\\ufeff\\nDividends are paid on stock units held by directors at the same rate and at the same time as\\nwe pay dividends on shares of our common stock. Dividends on stock units are paid in the form of additional\\nstock units.\\n\\ufeff\\nThere were 9 directors\\nparticipating in the Director Plans during all or part of 2017. The total plan units earned were 94,034,\\n29,618, and 22,279 in 2017, 2016\\nand 2015,\\nrespectively.\\n\\ufeff\\nTo the extent directors elect to receive the distribution of their stock unit account in cash,\\nthey are considered liability-based awards. To the extent directors elect to receive the distribution of their\\nstock unit accounts in common stock, they are considered equity-based awards.

The TCJA, makes broad and complex changes to the U.S.\\ntax code. The TCJA reduces the corporate tax rate to 21%,\\neffective January 1, 2018.

SAB 118 provides a measurement period\\nthat should not extend beyond one year from the TCJA enactment date for companies to complete the accounting\\nunder ASC 740, Income Taxes. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those\\naspects of the TCJA for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a company\\'s\\naccounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable\\nestimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements.\\n\\ufeff\\nAs a result of the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate, we\\nrevalued our net deferred tax liability, as of December 31, 2017.

The pension plan and postretirement benefit plans are closed to\\nthe majority of our newly hired employees. The benefits are based on years of\\nservice and final average pay or career average pay. Contributions are made in amounts sufficient to meet ERISA\\nfunding requirements while considering tax deductibility. Plan assets are invested in a diversified portfolio\\nof equity and fixed-income securities and alternative investments.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe accounting results for pension and other postretirement benefit costs\\nand obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions applied in the determination of such amounts.\\nThese actuarial assumptions include the following: discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan\\nassets, future compensation increases, employee turnover, healthcare cost trend rates, expected retirement age,\\noptional form of benefit and mortality. We review these assumptions for changes annually with our independent\\nactuaries. We consider our discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to be\\nour most critical assumptions.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe discount rate is used to value, on a present value basis, our pension and other\\npostretirement benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date. The same rate is also used in the interest\\ncost component of the pension and postretirement benefit cost determination for the following year. The\\nmeasurement date used in the selection of our discount rate is the balance sheet date. Our discount rate\\nassumption is determined annually with assistance from our independent actuaries based on the pattern of\\nexpected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long-term, high quality corporate bonds\\nthat approximate the benefit obligation.\\n\\ufeff\\nAs of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we utilized an estimation technique that is based upon a settlement model\\n(Bond:Link) that permits us to closely match cash flows to the expected payments to participants. This rate can\\nchange from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields.\\n\\ufeff\\nAs a result of the technique described above, Frontier is utilizing a\\ndiscount rate of 3.70% as of December 31,\\n2017 for its qualified pension plan, compared to rates\\nof 4.10% and 4.50%\\nin 2016 and 2015, respectively. The discount rate for postretirement plans as of December 31,\\n2017 was a range of 3.70%\\nto 3.80% compared to a range of\\n4.10% to 4.30% in 2016 and 4.50%\\nto 4.70% in 2015.\\n\\n\\n\\nF-37\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nThe Pension Plan contains provisions that provide certain employees with\\nthe option of receiving a lump sum payment upon retirement. Frontier\\'s accounting policy is to record these\\npayments as a settlement only if, in the aggregate, they exceed the sum of the annual service and interest\\ncosts for the Pension Plan\\'s net periodic pension benefit cost. During year ended December 31, 2017, lump sum\\npension settlement payments to terminated or retired individuals amounted to $486 million, which exceeded the settlement threshold of $224 million, and as a result, Frontier recognized non-cash settlement charges\\ntotaling $83 million during 2017. The non-cash charge\\naccelerated the recognition of a portion of the previously unrecognized actuarial losses in the Pension Plan.\\nThese non-cash charges increased our recorded net loss and accumulated deficit, with an offset to accumulated\\nother comprehensive loss in shareholders\\' equity.\\n\\ufeff\\nAs a result of the CTF Acquisition, the Frontier Communications Pension Plan\\n(the Plan) was remeasured. This remeasurement resulted in a decrease in the discount rate from\\n4.50% at December 31, 2015 to 4.00%\\nat the date of the CTF Acquisition. This change in the discount rate resulted in a\\nremeasurement charge to other comprehensive income (loss) of $105 million during 2016.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied in the\\ndetermination of periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost as a reduction in the computation of the\\nexpense. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we considered published surveys of\\nexpected market returns, 10 and 20 year actual returns of various major indices, and our own historical 5 year,\\n10 year and 20 year investment returns. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on an\\nasset allocation assumption of 40% in long-duration fixed\\nincome securities, and 60% in equity securities and other\\ninvestments. We review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate. Our\\npension asset investment allocation decisions are made by the Retirement Investment\\n& Administration Committee (RIAC), a committee comprised of members of management, pursuant to a delegation\\nof authority by the Retirement Plan Committee of the Board of Directors. The RIAC is responsible for reporting\\nits actions to the Retirement Plan Committee. Asset allocation decisions take into account expected market\\nreturn assumptions of various asset classes as well as expected pension benefit payment streams. When analyzing\\nanticipated benefit payments, management considers both the absolute amount of the payments as well as the\\ntiming of such payments.

In addition, GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which\\nprioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe three input levels in the hierarchy of fair value

This program\\nprovides $332 million in annual support, including\\n$49 million in annual support related to the properties acquired in\\nthe CTF Acquisition, through 2020 to make available 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream broadband service to\\napproximately 774,000 households across certain of the\\n29 states where we now operate. To the extent we do not enable the\\nrequired number of households with 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream broadband service by the end of the CAF\\nPhase II term, we will be required to return a portion of the funds previously received.\\n\\ufeff\\nOn April 28, 2016, the FCC completed its inquiry into whether certain terms and conditions\\ncontained in specifically identified special access tariff pricing plans offered by four carriers, including\\nFrontier, are just and reasonable. The FCC held that certain of the tariff terms for business data TDM\\nservices, specifically DS1s and DS3s, were unreasonable. Specifically, the FCC struck down \"excessive\" early\\ntermination fees and \"all-or-nothing\" provisions. Frontier has revised its tariffs in accordance with the FCC\\'s\\nOrder. The FCC\\'s decision has no retroactive effect, and we anticipate no material impact to Frontier from\\nit.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe FCC deferred the issue of how its ruling will affect customers currently\\npurchasing services from these tariffs to a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. It is seeking comment on proposed\\nchanges to the way the FCC regulates traditional special access services and,\\non a proposal, to adopt pricing rules for\\nEthernet services in markets that are found to be \"noncompetitive.\" The potential impact to Frontier of this\\nproceeding is unknown, though any pending initiative could adversely affect our operations or financial\\nresults.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe are party to various legal proceedings (including individual, class and putative class\\nactions, governmental investigations) arising in the normal course of our business covering a wide range of\\nmatters and types of claims including, but not limited to, general contracts, billing disputes, rights of\\naccess, taxes and surcharges, consumer protection, advertising, trademark and patent infringement, employment,\\nregulatory, tort, claims of competitors and disputes with other carriers. Litigation is subject to uncertainty\\nand the outcome of individual matters is not predictable. However, we believe that the ultimate resolution of\\nall such matters, after considering insurance coverage or other indemnities to which we are entitled, will not\\nhave a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn October 2013, the California Attorney General\\'s Office notified certain Verizon companies,\\nincluding one of the subsidiaries that we acquired in the CTF Acquisition, of potential violations of\\nCalifornia state hazardous waste statutes primarily arising from the disposal of electronic components,\\nbatteries and aerosol cans at certain California facilities. We are cooperating with this investigation. We\\nhave accrued an amount for potential penalties that we deem to be probable and reasonably estimated, and we do\\nnot expect that any potential penalties, if ultimately incurred, will be material in comparison to the\\nestablished accrual.\\n\\n\\n\\nF-47\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ufeff\\nWe accrue an expense for pending litigation when we determine that an\\nunfavorable outcome is probable, and the amount of the loss\\ncan be reasonably estimated. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred. None of our existing accruals for\\npending matters, after considering insurance coverage, is material. We monitor our pending litigation for the\\npurpose of adjusting our accruals and revising our disclosures accordingly, when required. Litigation is,\\nhowever, subject to uncertainty, and the outcome of any particular matter is not predictable. We will\\nvigorously defend our interests in pending litigation, and as of this date, we believe that the ultimate\\nresolution of all such matters, after considering insurance coverage or other indemnities to which we are\\nentitled, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of\\noperations, or our cash flows.\\n\\ufeff\\nWe conduct certain of our operations in leased premises and also lease\\ncertain equipment and other assets pursuant to operating leases.

Sedgwick, a third-party claims administrator,\\nadministers the casualty claims and make claim payments on our behalf. We reimburse Sedgwick for such services\\nupon presentation of their invoice. However, to serve as our insurance carrier, AIG Insurance requires that we\\nestablish a letter of credit in their favor.

The equity interests of the\\nremaining subsidiaries of the Company are not pledged to secure the obligations under these debt\\nagreements.\\n\\ufeff\\nIn connection with the 2018 Credit Amendment, the Company expanded the security package to\\ninclude the pledge of the outstanding equity interests in certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company not\\npreviously pledged (together with the Original Pledged Subsidiaries, the \"Pledged Subsidiaries\").\\n\\ufeff\\nThe financial statements were prepared using Frontier\\'s historical basis in the assets and\\nliabilities of the Pledged Subsidiaries, and its combined financial statements include all revenue, costs,\\nassets, and liabilities directly attributable to the Pledged Subsidiaries. Historically, Frontier provided\\ncertain corporate services to the Pledged Subsidiaries and costs associated with these functions have been\\nallocated to the Pledged Subsidiaries. Management believes these expenses have been allocated using reasonable\\nallocation methodologies to the services provided, primarily based on relative percentage of total net sales,\\nrelative percentage of headcount, or specific identification.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe allocations may not reflect the expense the Pledged Subsidiaries would have incurred as a\\nstand-alone company for the periods presented. Actual costs that may have been incurred if the Pledged\\nSubsidiaries had been a stand-alone company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen\\norganizational structure, what functions were outsourced or performed by employees, and strategic decisions\\nmade in certain areas. The total shareholder\\'s equity represents Frontier\\'s interest in the Pledged\\nSubsidiaries\\' recorded net assets.\\n\\ufeff\\nAllocated operating expenses include corporate costs, employee benefits\\n(medical, dental and vision), 401(k) contributions, pension and postretirement benefits, stock-based\\ncompensation relating to restricted stock issuances, collections on receivables and acquisition and integration\\ncosts incurred by Frontier. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation expense, are allocated from Frontier primarily based on customer counts and\\nheadcount.\\n\\ufeff\\nTaxes are allocated from Frontier based on the Pledged Subsidiaries\\'\\nrelative contribution to the consolidated financial results.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe Pledged Subsidiaries are part of a centralized cash management system with Frontier in\\nwhich cash received by Frontier on Pledged Subsidiaries\\' behalf and cash disbursements made by Frontier on\\nPledged Subsidiaries\\' behalf are recorded through intercompany accounts. These transactions include receipts\\nand disbursements related to income taxes attributable to federal and state jurisdictions and capital\\nexpenditures, among others.\\n\\ufeff\\nThe following supplemental financial information presents the consolidating\\nbalance sheet information and statement of\\noperations information of the Pledged Subsidiaries, all\\nother Frontier entities, and the Pledged Subsidiaries and all other Frontier entities on a consolidated\\nbasis, as of and for the year ended December 31,\\n2017.

Service by the Indemnitee. The Indemnitee shall serve and/or continue to serve as a director or officer of Frontier faithfully\\nand to the best of the Indemnitee\\'s ability so long as the Indemnitee is duly elected or appointed and until\\nsuch time as the Indemnitee\\'s successor is elected and qualified or the Indemnitee is removed as permitted by\\napplicable law or tenders a resignation in writing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Indemnification and Advancement of\\nExpenses.

Action or Proceedings Other than an Action\\nby or in the Right of Frontier. Except as limited by Section 3 above, the Indemnitee\\nshall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin this Section if the Indemnitee was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or\\nwas or is otherwise involved in, any Proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of Frontier) by reason\\nof the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of Frontier or while\\na director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of Frontier is or was serving at the request of Frontier as a\\ndirector, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,\\ntrust, or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, or by reason of\\nanything done or not done by the Indemnitee in any such capacity. Pursuant to this Section, the Indemnitee\\nshall be indemnified against all expense, liability, and loss (including judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes,\\npenalties, amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of the Indemnitee, and Expenses) actually and reasonably\\nincurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding, if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a\\nmanner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of Frontier, and with\\nrespect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Indemnity in Proceedings by or in the Right\\nof Frontier. Except as limited by Section 3 above, the Indemnitee shall be entitled\\nto the indemnification rights provided in this Section if the Indemnitee was or is a party or is threatened to\\nbe made a party to, or was or is otherwise involved in, any Proceeding brought by or in the right of Frontier\\nto procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director, officer,\\nemployee, agent, or trustee of Frontier or while a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of Frontier\\nis or was serving at the request of Frontier as a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of another\\ncorporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including service with respect to\\nan employee benefit plan, or by reason of anything done or not done by the Indemnitee in any such capacity.\\nPursuant to this Section, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all expense, liability, and loss\\n(including judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, penalties, amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of the\\nIndemnitee, and Expenses) actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding\\nif the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not\\nopposed to the best interests of Frontier; provided, however, that no such indemnification shall be\\nmade in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which the DGCL expressly prohibits such indemnification by\\nreason of any adjudication of liability of the Indemnitee to Frontier, unless and only to the extent that the\\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such Proceeding was brought shall determine\\nupon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case,\\nthe Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification for such expense, liability, and loss as such court shall deem\\nproper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6. Indemnification for Costs, Charges, and\\nExpenses of Successful Party. Notwithstanding any limitations of Sections 3(c), 4,\\nand 5 above, to the extent that the Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in whole or in\\npart, in defense of any Proceeding, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, including, without\\nlimitation, the dismissal of any action without prejudice, or if it is ultimately determined, by final judicial\\ndecision of a court of competent jurisdiction from which there is no further right to appeal, that the\\nIndemnitee is otherwise entitled to be indemnified against Expenses, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified\\nagainst all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection therewith.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7. Partial Indemnification. If the Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by Frontier\\nfor some or a portion of the expense, liability, and loss (including judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes,\\npenalties, amounts paid in settlement by or on\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbehalf of the Indemnitee, and Expenses) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with\\nany Proceeding, or in connection with any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 11 to enforce\\nrights under this Agreement, but not, however, for all of the total amount thereof, Frontier shall nevertheless\\nindemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such expense, liability, and loss actually and reasonably incurred\\nto which the Indemnitee is entitled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8. Indemnification for Expenses of a\\nWitness. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the maximum\\nextent permitted by the DGCL, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification against all Expenses actually\\nand reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee or on the Indemnitee\\'s behalf if the Indemnitee appears as a witness\\nor otherwise incurs legal expenses as a result of or related to the Indemnitee\\'s service as a director or\\nofficer of Frontier, in any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute\\nresolution mechanism, inquiry, judicial, administrative, or legislative hearing, investigation, or any other\\nthreatened, pending, or completed proceeding, whether of a civil, criminal, administrative, legislative,\\ninvestigative, or other nature, to which the Indemnitee neither is, nor is threatened to be made, a\\nparty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9. Determination of Entitlement to\\nIndemnification. To receive indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee\\nshall submit a written request to the Chief Executive Officer or the Secretary of Frontier. Such request shall\\ninclude such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably\\nnecessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (the\\n\"Supporting Documentation\"). The Secretary of Frontier\\nshall promptly advise the Board of Directors in writing that the Indemnitee has requested indemnification. The\\ndetermination of the Indemnitee\\'s entitlement to indemnification shall be made by the following person or\\npersons who shall be empowered to make such determination: (a) a majority of the Disinterested Directors\\n(including by the Disinterested Director, if there is only one); (b) a majority of a committee of Disinterested\\nDirectors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors; (c) Independent Counsel, if a majority\\nof the Disinterested Directors so directs or there are no Disinterested Directors, in a written opinion to the\\nBoard of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee; (d) the stockholders of Frontier (but\\nonly if a majority of the Disinterested Directors determines that the issue of entitlement to indemnification\\nshould be submitted to the stockholders for their determination); (e) in the event that a Change in Control has\\noccurred and the Indemnitee so requests (in which case the Disinterested Directors shall be deemed to have so\\ndirected), by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be\\ndelivered to the Indemnitee; or (f) as provided in Section 10. In the event the determination of entitlement to\\nindemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel, a majority of the Disinterested Directors shall select\\nthe Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which the Indemnitee does not reasonably\\nobject; provided, however, that if a Change in Control has occurred or there are no\\nDisinterested Directors, the Indemnitee shall select such Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel\\nto which the Board of Directors does not reasonably object. Upon failure of the Disinterested Directors (or the\\nIndemnitee, in the event a Change in Control has occurred or there are no Disinterested Directors) to select\\nsuch Independent Counsel or upon objection by the Indemnitee or Board of Directors to the selection of\\nIndependent Counsel, such Independent Counsel shall be selected upon application to a court of competent\\njurisdiction. The determination of the Indemnitee\\'s entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later than\\n60 calendar days after receipt by Frontier of the written request therefor together with the Supporting\\nDocumentation, and unless a contrary determination is made, such indemnification shall be paid in full not\\nlater than five calendar days after such determination has been made, or is deemed to have been made pursuant\\nto Section 10. If the person\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmaking such determination shall determine that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification\\nas to part (but not all) of the application for indemnification, such person shall reasonably prorate such\\npartial indemnification among the claims, issues, or matters at issue at the time of the determination.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10. Presumptions and Effect of Certain\\nProceedings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in\\nthis Agreement, the Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification upon submission of a request\\nfor indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation, and thereafter in any determination or review\\nof any determination, and in any suit, arbitration or adjudication, Frontier shall have the burden of proof to\\novercome that presumption, including the burden of proof that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of\\nconduct described above and also the burden of proof on any of the issues which may be material to a\\ndetermination that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification. In any event, if the person or persons\\nempowered under Section 9 to determine entitlement to indemnification shall not have been appointed or shall\\nnot have made a determination within 60 calendar days after receipt by Frontier of the request therefor\\ntogether with the Supporting Documentation, the Indemnitee shall be deemed to be entitled to indemnification.\\nIn either case, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification, unless: (i) the Indemnitee\\nmisrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the\\nSupporting Documentation; or (ii) such indemnification is prohibited by law, in either case as ultimately\\ndetermined by final judicial decision of a court of competent jurisdiction from which there is no further right\\nto appeal, or, at the Indemnitee\\'s sole option, arbitration as provided in Section 11.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) The termination of any Proceeding, or of\\nany claim, issue, or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of\\nnolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself,\\nadversely affect the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification or create any presumption with respect to any\\nstandard of conduct or belief or any other matter which might form a basis for a determination that the\\nIndemnitee is not entitled to indemnification.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) With regard to the right to indemnification\\nfor Expenses: (i) if and to the extent that the Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise, in\\nwhole or in part, in defense of any Proceeding; (ii) if a Proceeding was terminated without a determination of\\nliability on the part of the Indemnitee with respect to any claim, issue, or matter therein or without any\\npayments in settlement or compromise being made by the Indemnitee with respect to a claim, issue, or matter\\ntherein; or (iii) if and to the extent that the Indemnitee was not a party to the Proceeding, the Indemnitee\\nshall be deemed to be entitled to indemnification, which entitlement shall not be defeated or diminished by any\\ndetermination which may be made pursuant to Section 9.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) The Indemnitee shall be presumptively\\nentitled to indemnification in all respects for any act, omission, or conduct taken or occurring which (whether\\nby condition or otherwise) is required, authorized, or approved by any order issued or other action by any\\ncommission or governmental body pursuant to any federal statute or state statute regulating Frontier or any of\\nits subsidiaries by reason of its status as a public utility or public utility holding company or by reason of\\nits activities as such. To the extent permitted by law, the presumption shall be conclusive on all parties with\\nrespect to acts, omissions, or conduct of the Indemnitee if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or\\nshe reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of Frontier or its subsidiaries. No\\npresumption adverse to the Indemnitee shall be drawn with respect to any act, omission, or conduct of the\\nIndemnitee if he or she acted in good faith and in\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of\\nFrontier or its subsidiaries taken or occurring in the absence of, or inconsistent with, any order issued or\\naction by any commission or governmental body.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11. Remedies of the Indemnitee in Cases of\\nDetermination Not to Indemnify or to Advance Expenses; Right to Bring Suit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) In the event that a determination is made\\npursuant to Section 9 that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder, or if payment is not\\ntimely made following a determination of entitlement to indemnification pursuant to Sections 9 or 10, or if an\\nadvancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 16, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter\\nseek an adjudication of his or her entitlement to payment either, at the Indemnitee\\'s sole option, in: (i) an\\nappropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction; or (ii) to the extent\\nconsistent with law, arbitration to be conducted by three arbitrators (or, if the dispute involves less than\\n$100,000, by a single arbitrator) pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any such suit\\nor arbitration shall be de novo and the Indemnitee shall\\nnot be prejudiced by reason of such adverse determination. Frontier shall not oppose the Indemnitee\\'s right to\\nseek any such adjudication or award in arbitration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) In any suit or arbitration brought by the\\nIndemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of Expenses hereunder, or in any suit\\nbrought by Frontier to recover an advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden\\nof proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under\\nthis Section 11 or otherwise shall be on Frontier. Neither the failure of Frontier (including the Disinterested\\nDirectors, a committee of Disinterested Directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a\\ndetermination prior to the commencement of a suit or arbitration regarding whether indemnification of the\\nIndemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the standard of conduct described\\nabove, nor an actual determination by Frontier (including the Disinterested Directors, a committee of\\nDisinterested Directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met the standard\\nof conduct described above shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct.\\nNeither a failure to make such a determination of entitlement nor an adverse determination of entitlement to\\nindemnification shall be a defense of Frontier in a suit or arbitration brought by the Indemnitee or a suit by\\nor on behalf of Frontier relating to indemnification or create any presumption that the indemnitee has not met\\nthe standard of conduct described above or is otherwise not entitled to indemnification. In any suit brought by\\nFrontier to recover an advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, Frontier shall be\\nentitled to recover such Expenses upon a final judicial decision of a court of competent jurisdiction from\\nwhich there is no further right to appeal that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct described\\nabove.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) If a determination shall have been made or\\ndeemed to have been made, pursuant to Sections 9 or 10, that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification,\\nFrontier shall be obligated to pay the amounts constituting such indemnification within five calendar days\\nafter such determination has been made or deemed to have been made, as required by Section 9, and shall be\\nconclusively bound by such determination, unless: (i) the Indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a\\nmaterial fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation; or (ii) such\\nindemnification is prohibited by law, in either case as ultimately determined by final judicial decision of a\\ncourt of competent jurisdiction from which there is no\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfurther right to appeal, or, at the Indemnitee\\'s sole option, arbitration as provided in\\nSection 11. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Frontier may bring suit, in an appropriate court in the State of\\nDelaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction, contesting the right of the Indemnitee to receive\\nIndemnification hereunder due to the occurrence of a circumstance described in clause (i) above or a\\nprohibition of law (both of which are herein referred to as a \"Disqualifying Circumstance\"). In either\\ninstance, if the Indemnitee shall elect, at his or her sole option, that such dispute shall be determined by\\narbitration (as provided in Section 19(d)(i)), the Indemnitee and Frontier shall submit the controversy to\\narbitration. In any such suit or arbitration, whether brought by the Indemnitee or Frontier, the Indemnitee\\nshall be entitled to indemnification unless Frontier can satisfy the burden of proof that indemnification is\\nprohibited by reason of a Disqualifying Circumstance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) Frontier shall be precluded from asserting\\nin any suit or arbitration commenced pursuant to Section 11 that the procedures and presumptions or any other\\nprovisions of this Agreement are not valid, binding, and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or\\nbefore any such arbitrator or arbitrators that Frontier is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12. Non-Exclusivity of\\nRights. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of Expenses provided by\\nthis Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right that the Indemnitee may now or hereafter\\nacquire under any applicable law, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors, provisions of a\\ncertificate or bylaws (including the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Frontier), or otherwise. The\\nIndemnitee is free to proceed under any of the rights available to him or her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n13. Expenses to Enforce\\nAgreement. In the event that the Indemnitee seeks a judicial adjudication of or an\\naward in arbitration to enforce his or her rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement,\\nor is otherwise involved in any adjudication or arbitration with respect to his or her rights under this\\nAgreement, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from Frontier, and shall be indemnified by Frontier\\nagainst, any Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such adjudication\\nor award in arbitration (including, but not limited to, any appellate proceedings) if the Indemnitee prevails\\nin such judicial adjudication or arbitration, to the fullest extent permitted by law. If it shall be determined\\nin such judicial adjudication or arbitration that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the\\nindemnification or advancement of Expenses sought, the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with\\nsuch judicial adjudication or arbitration shall be prorated accordingly. In any suit brought by Frontier to\\nrecover an advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, Frontier shall pay all Expenses\\nactually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such suit to the extent the Indemnitee\\nhas been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of such suit, to the fullest extent permitted by\\nlaw.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n14. Continuation of\\nIndemnity. All agreements and obligations of Frontier contained herein shall\\ncontinue during the period the Indemnitee is a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of Frontier or\\nwhile a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee is serving at the request of Frontier as a director,\\nofficer, employee, agent, or trustee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other\\nenterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, and shall continue thereafter with\\nrespect to any possible claims based on the fact that the Indemnitee was a director, officer, employee, agent,\\nor trustee of Frontier or was serving at the request of Frontier as a director, officer, employee, agent, or\\ntrustee of another corporation or of a\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npartnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including service with respect to an\\nemployee benefit plan. This Agreement shall be binding upon all successors and assigns of Frontier (including\\nany transferee of all or substantially all of its assets and any successor by merger or operation of law) and\\nshall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee\\'s heirs, executors, and administrators.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15. Notification; Selection of\\nCounsel. Promptly after receipt by the Indemnitee of notice of any Proceeding, the\\nIndemnitee shall, if a request for indemnification or an advancement of Expenses in respect thereof is to be\\nmade against Frontier under this Agreement, notify Frontier in writing of the commencement thereof; but the\\nomission so to notify Frontier shall not relieve it from any liability or obligation that it may have to the\\nIndemnitee.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section\\n15(b), Frontier may, if appropriate, assume the defense of a Proceeding, with legal counsel approved by the\\nIndemnitee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. With respect to a Proceeding, Frontier may\\nsatisfy its obligations under this Agreement by paying for single counsel for a group of indemnitees, and legal\\ncounsel may represent both the Indemnitee and Frontier (and/or any other indemnitees entitled to receive\\nadvancement of Expenses or indemnification from Frontier with respect to such matter), in each case unless: (i)\\nthe Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between Frontier and\\nthe Indemnitee or any other such indemnitees; or (ii) under the applicable standards of professional conduct\\nthen prevailing, such legal counsel would have a conflict of interest. Any counsel retained in accordance with\\nthe preceding sentence shall be approved by the Indemnitee (and any other such indemnitees), by majority vote\\nof indemnitees who are directors, president, or executive vice presidents of Frontier, which approval shall not\\nbe unreasonably withheld. If Frontier has directors\\' and officers\\' insurance, or other insurance, with a panel\\ncounsel requirement that may cover the matter for which advancement of Expenses or indemnification is sought,\\nthen such counsel shall be selected from among the panel counsel or other counsel approved by the insurers,\\nunless Frontier waives such requirement in writing.\\n(b) In any Proceeding brought by or in the\\nright of Frontier to procure a judgment in its favor, the Indemnitee (and/or any other indemnitees entitled to\\nreceive advancement of Expenses or indemnification from Frontier with respect to such matter) shall be entitled\\nto select single counsel of their choice to represent such group of indemnitees, and such counsel shall\\nrepresent the group of indemnitees unless: (i) the Indemnitee or another indemnitee shall have reasonably\\nconcluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Indemnitee or any other such indemnitees; or\\n(ii) under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, such legal counsel would have a\\nconflict of interest. Counsel for the group of indemnitees shall be selected and approved by majority vote of\\nthe indemnitees who are directors, president, or executive vice presidents of Frontier, which approval shall\\nnot be unreasonably withheld. If Frontier has directors\\' and officers\\' insurance, or other insurance, with a\\npanel counsel requirement that may cover the matter for which advancement of Expenses or indemnification is\\nsought, then such counsel shall be selected from among the panel counsel or other counsel approved by the\\ninsurers, unless Frontier waives such requirement in writing. Frontier shall not be entitled to assume the\\ndefense of any Proceeding brought by or in the right of Frontier to procure a judgment in its favor.\\n(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this\\nAgreement, the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ the Indemnitee\\'s own counsel in any Proceeding, but,\\nexcept as set forth in Sections 15(a) or 15(b) hereof, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the\\nexpense of the\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndemnitee unless: (i) there is a conflict of interest as described above; or (ii) the\\nemployment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by Frontier.\\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this\\nAgreement, Frontier shall not be liable to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid\\nin settlement of any Proceeding effected without Frontier\\'s written consent. Frontier shall not settle any\\nProceeding in any manner that would impose any penalty or limitation on or disclosure obligation with respect\\nto the Indemnitee without the Indemnitee\\'s written consent, or that would directly or indirectly constitute or\\nimpose any admission or acknowledgment of fault or culpability with respect to the Indemnitee without the\\nIndemnitee\\'s written consent. Neither Frontier nor the Indemnitee shall unreasonably withhold its consent to\\nany proposed settlement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n16. Advancement of Expenses. All Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in defending any Proceeding described in Section 4 or 5 shall\\nbe paid by Frontier in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding at the request of the Indemnitee. To\\nreceive an advancement of Expenses under this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall submit a written request to the\\nChief Executive Officer or the Secretary of Frontier. Such request shall reasonably evidence the Expenses\\nincurred or about to be incurred by the Indemnitee and, if required by law at the time of such advancement,\\nshall include or be accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay the amounts\\nadvanced if it shall ultimately be determined, by final judicial decision of a court of competent jurisdiction\\nfrom which there is no further right to appeal, that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such\\nExpenses by Frontier as provided by this Agreement or otherwise. The Indemnitee\\'s undertaking to repay any such\\namounts is not required to be secured. Each such advancement of Expenses shall be made within 20 calendar days\\nafter receipt by Frontier of such written request. The Indemnitee\\'s entitlement to Expenses under this\\nAgreement shall include those incurred in connection with any action, suit, or proceeding by the Indemnitee\\nseeking an adjudication or award in arbitration pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement (including the\\nenforcement of this provision) to the extent the court or arbitrator shall determine that the Indemnitee is\\nentitled to an advancement of Expenses hereunder.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n17. Severability. If\\nany provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any\\nreason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement\\n(including, without limitation, all portions of any paragraphs of this Agreement containing any such provision\\nheld to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that are not by themselves invalid, illegal, or unenforceable)\\nshall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of\\nthis Agreement (including, without limitation, all portions of any paragraph of this Agreement containing any\\nsuch provision held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal, or\\nunenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent of the parties that Frontier provide\\nprotection to the Indemnitee to the fullest enforceable extent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n18.

Other Provisions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) This Agreement and all disputes or\\ncontroversies arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance\\nwith, the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the laws of any other jurisdiction that\\nmight be applied because of conflicts of laws principles of the State of Delaware.\\n(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this\\nAgreement, in the event that the Indemnitee elects, as an alternative to the procedures specified in this\\nAgreement, to follow one of the procedures authorized by applicable corporate law or statute to enforce his or\\nher rights under this Agreement and notifies Frontier of his or her election, Frontier agrees to follow the\\nprocedure so elected by the Indemnitee. If in accordance with the preceding sentence, the procedure therefor\\ncontemplated herein or the procedure elected by the Indemnitee in any specific circumstances (or such election\\nby the Indemnitee) shall be invalid or ineffective in bringing about a valid and binding determination of the\\nentitlement of the Indemnitee to indemnification or advancement of Expenses under this Agreement, the most\\nnearly comparable procedure authorized by applicable corporate law or statute shall be followed by Frontier and\\nthe Indemnitee.\\n(c) Frontier may create a trust fund, grant a\\nsecurity interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit, surety bonds and/or\\nother similar arrangements) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification\\nor advancement of Expenses pursuant to this Agreement.\\n(d) This Agreement may be executed in two or\\nmore counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and shall become effective when\\none or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party.\\n(e) This Agreement shall not be deemed an\\nemployment contract between Frontier and any Indemnitee who is an officer of Frontier, and, if the Indemnitee\\nis an officer of Frontier, the Indemnitee specifically acknowledges that the Indemnitee may be discharged at\\nany time for any reason, with or without cause, and with or without severance compensation, except as may be\\notherwise provided in a separate written contract between the Indemnitee and Frontier.\\n(f) In the event of payment under this\\nAgreement, Frontier shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the\\nIndemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such\\nrights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable Frontier effectively to bring suit to\\nenforce such rights.\\n(g) This Agreement may not be amended,\\nmodified, or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in\\nwriting specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each party. No failure or delay of\\neither party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or\\npartial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such\\nright or power, or any course of conduct, shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise\\nof any other right or power.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, Frontier and the Indemnitee have caused this Agreement to be executed as\\nof the date first written above.\\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS

Our management periodically reviews whether   or not to be active in repurchasing our stock. In making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, we   consider multiple factors. The factors may include: overall stock market conditions, our common stock price   movements, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board of directors, the potential impact of   a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital   needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and   capital resources"

At December  2017, the  fair   value of investments held for all deferred compensation plans was $234.3 million, of which $32.6 million  was   recorded in other current  assets and $201.7  million was recorded in  other assets (Note  I).
